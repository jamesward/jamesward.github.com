I'll be doing a "Building High Performance RIAs" session and a "The Open Source RIA Stack" session.  <a href="http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/">Chet Haase</a> will be doing a "Filthy Rich [Flex] Clients" session.  Bob Tierney will be doing a "LiveCycle Data Services" session and a "LiveCycle and BEA" session.  <a href="http://technoracle.blogspot.com/">Duane Nickull</a> will also be doing sessions.  We also have one guest presenter, Igor Polevoy from <a href="http://exadel.com/">Exadel</a>, who will be demonstrating Flex and Seam integration with <a href="http://flamingo.exadel.com/">Flamingo</a>.  Igor's session will be at 1pm on Tuesday.  Other session times are TBD - so stop by the booth on Tuesday to pickup a schedule.  Also, make sure that you come to the Filthy Rich [Flex] Clients session with Stephan Jansen (of <a href="http://www.parleys.com/display/V21Beta/Home">Parleys.com</a> and <a href="http://javapolis.com">JavaPolis</a>), Chet Haase, and myself which precedes the Adobe party on Wednesday night.  Stop by the booth to pickup an invite.  See you there!</p>

<p><strong><em>  Quick Update: Duane will also be doing a hands-on Flex and AIR session at CommunityOne on Monday at noon.  I'll be doing a Lightning Talk at noon and hanging out with the RedMonk folks at CommunityOne.  </em></strong></p>
