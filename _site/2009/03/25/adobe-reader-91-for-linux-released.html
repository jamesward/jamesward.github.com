Adobe has released <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/">Adobe Reader 9.1 for Linux</a>!  This is the first 9.x release on Linux and has a number of new features.  My personal favorite is the inclusion of Flash Player so that <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/blog/portable-rias-tutorial/">Portable RIAs</a> will work on Linux!  Portable RIAs are beginning to catch on more and so it's great to have true cross-platform support for them.
