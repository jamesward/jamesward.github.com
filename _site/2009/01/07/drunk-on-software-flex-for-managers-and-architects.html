Episode 6 of the <a href="http://www.drunkonsoftware.com">Drunk on Software </a>video podcast is <a href="http://www.drunkonsoftware.com/2009/01/05/episode-6-flex-for-managers-and-architects/">now available</a>!  This one is a bit long but dives into a lot of good information.  I frequently get the same sorts of questions from developers, IT managers, and architects about Flex.  Jon and I discuss those questions in this episode.  Let us know what you think!
