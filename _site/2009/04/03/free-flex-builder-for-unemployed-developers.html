Flex Builder is now free for not only students and educators but also for those who are currently unemployed!  If you fall into this category - my sympathies - but hopefully by learning Flex you can get a job again soon.  And since the Flex job market is <a href="http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=%22adobe+flex%22">super hot</a>, getting a new Flex job shouldn't be too hard. :)

All you need to do is go to <a href="https://freeriatools.adobe.com/">freeriatools.adobe.com</a> and (honestly) fill out the information.  I hope this helps get you on your feet again!
