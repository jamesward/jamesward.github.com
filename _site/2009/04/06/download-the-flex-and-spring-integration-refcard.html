<a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/flex-spring-integration"><img src="http://refcardz.dzone.com/sites/all/files/refcardz/covers/9247.png" align="right"></a>DZone has just published a new Refcard "<a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/flex-spring-integration">Flex &amp; Spring Integration</a>" written by <a href="http://www.ectropic.com">Jon Rose</a> and me.  This is the second Refcard I've written.  The first was "<a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/very-first-steps-flex">Very First Steps in Flex</a>," which was a few chapters from <a href="http://www.firststepsinflex.com">First Steps in Flex</a> written by Bruce Eckel and me.  Working on the Flex &amp; Spring Integration Refcard was fun because I was able to learn more about the new <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-flex">Spring BlazeDS Integration</a> project from SpringSource.  I've been really impressed with how easy it is to integrate Flex and Spring together.  Another great resource for learning how to integrate Flex and Spring is Christophe Coenraets' <a href="http://coenraets.org/blog/2009/03/springblazeds-integration-test-drive-m2-update-available/">Spring BlazeDS Integration Test Drive</a>.  It contains a bunch of great examples that will help you better understand how to get everything set up and working.

Let me know what you think about the Refcard.  I hope it's useful for you!
