<font color="red">UPDATE - I've created a <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/blog/2009/04/16/flex-paint-2/">new version of Flex Paint</a> which doesn't require the server roundtrip.</font>

Flex allows you to easily create beautiful UIs.  But what if you want to take a piece of the UI and save it as an image?  Well, using <a href="http://www.kaourantin.net/2005/10/png-encoder-in-as3.html">Tinic's AS3 PNG Encoder</a>, Remote Object, and Flash's BitmapData and ByteArray API it's very easy.  To show how this is done, I created a simple application called Flex Paint.

<b>How it Works</b>

We use the Flash drawing API to draw on a canvas.  Then when the "Save Image" button is clicked we do a few simple things.  First we create a new BitmapData object:
var bd:BitmapData = new BitmapData(canvas.width,canvas.height);

Then we copy canvas' pixels onto the BitmapData object:
bd.draw(canvas);

Now we convert the BitmapData object to a ByteArray encoded as a PNG:
var ba:ByteArray = PNGEnc.encode(bd);

And then upload the PNG via Remote Object:
ro.doUpload(ba);

Then Remote Object just saves the file to the file system.  If you would like to download the code for Flex Paint, you can find it on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexapps/">Source Forge</a>.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks!
