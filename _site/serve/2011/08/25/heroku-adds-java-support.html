Today <a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/8/25/java/">Heroku announced</a> that Java is now supported on the Heroku Cloud Application Platform!  This is incredibly exciting news and I'm very lucky to be a Heroku for Java Developer Evangelist!

Joining salesforce.com and jumping into the the Java Cloud space holds some nostalgia for me.  When I began using Java in 1997 I was working at an ISP in Denver.  We did the regular web hosting thing, but when the first Java Servlet engines (like Java Web Server 1.0) came out, I created the "wantjava.com" hosting service.  Things were really nasty at first.  We could only run one instance of the JWS on a server so I came up with a really bad way to do "multi-tenancy".  I setup a cron job to rsync the customers' .class files into the server's webapp and then restart the server.  Customers had to email me to get a servlet added to the web.xml file.  Uggg...  I feel like I need to go to confession for this.  But it worked and as the Servlet containers improved we quickly migrated to a more sustainable model.

Now thirteen years later I am privileged to once again be part of Java on the Cloud.  But this time around things are so much easier, better, and sexier!  Heroku is a leading the way in a new generation of application deployment that is making things much better for us Java developers.

<h2>What is Heroku?</h2>

Shortly I will dive into how you can run Java on Heroku, but first, what is Heroku?  From my perspective, Heroku is a <a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/8/3/polyglot_platform/">Polyglot Cloud Application Platform</a>.  Heroku provides us a way to run Ruby, Node.js, Clojure, and Java applications on a managed, scalable, and multi-tenant system.  Heroku also provides <a href="http://addons.heroku.com">numerous add-ons</a> that help us make the <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/2011/07/12/architectural-evolution-from-middleware-to-the-cloud">shift from monolithic middleware to Cloud Components</a>.  Another way to say it is:

<strong><pre>Heroku = Polyglot + Platform as a Service (PaaS) + Cloud Components</pre></strong>

It is very exciting to see these three things coming together!  With Polyglot I can choose the right tool for the job.  With PaaS I don't have to think about managing operating systems, scalability, failover, etc.  And with the Cloud Component Architecture I can keep my app thin and focused on what is unique to the problem it needs to solve.  Heroku brings these models together as a cloud application platform.

<h2>Running Java Apps on Heroku</h2>

Heroku can run any Java app that runs in OpenJDK 6.  Today Heroku uses Maven to create a "<a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler">slug</a>" for Java apps.  That slug can then be loaded onto one or more "<a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos">dynos</a>".  You can tell a dyno to execute / start a Java app from the command line and you can also use a "<a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile">Procfile</a>" to provide a command that will auto-start for each instance of a specific dyno type.  Web dynos are able to listen on a port and will receive HTTP traffic through a load balancer that is automatically setup for each app.  With that background knowledge, lets dive into code!

For Dreamforce 2011, I (with the help of a few co-workers) put together a <a href="http://github.com/heroku/java-workbook">Heroku for Java Workbook</a>.  The Workbook provides detailed instructions on how to create web apps, connect to a database, setup worker processes, use the Redis to Go Heroku add-on, and use Spring Roo on Heroku.  But if you are anxious to get started and don't need as much hand-holding, here is a quick and very simple walk through of how to run Java on Heroku:

<ol>
<li>Install the heroku command line client on <a href="http://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/linux/readme">Linux</a>, <a href="http://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/osx/download">Mac</a>, or <a href="http://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/windows/download">Windows</a>.</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> and setup your ssh key</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a></li>
<li>
Login to Heroku from the command line:
<pre lang="bash">heroku auth:login</pre>
</li>
<li>
Create a new project directory and move into it:
<pre lang="bash">mkdir helloherokujava
cd helloherokujava</pre>
</li>
<li>
Create a Maven build file named <code>pom.xml</code> containing:
<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>foo</groupId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <name>helloherokujava</name>
    <artifactId>helloherokujava</artifactId>
</project>
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Create a Java source directory:
<pre lang="bash">mkdir -p src/main/java</pre>
</li>
<li>
Create a new Java class in the <code>src/main/java</code> directory named <code>Hello.java</code> containing:
<pre lang="java">public class Hello
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    System.out.println("hello, world");
  }
}</pre>
</li>
<li>
Compile the class:
<pre lang="bash">mvn compile</pre>
</li>
<li>
Run the class locally:
<pre lang="bash">java -cp target/classes Hello</pre>
</li>
<li>
Create a local git repo, add the <code>pom.xml</code> file & <code>src</code> dir, and commit the files:
<pre lang="bash">git init
git add pom.xml src
git commit -m init</pre>
</li>
<li>
Create a new app on Heroku using the Cedar stack:
<pre lang="bash">heroku create -s cedar</pre>
</li>
<li>
Upload your app to Heroku:
<pre lang="bash">git push heroku master</pre>
Heroku will create a slug for your app.
</li>
<li>
Run the app on Heroku:
<pre lang="bash">heroku run "java -cp target/classes Hello"</pre>
Heroku will start a new dyno with your slug and then run the specified command.
</li>
</ol>
You just ran Java on the cloud!  Obviously this is a very simple example.  But I like to start new things with the simplest thing that could possibly work.  Now that you have that working there is more to learn and much more power to harness!
