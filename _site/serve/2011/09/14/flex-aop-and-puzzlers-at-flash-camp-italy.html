Next week I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.flex-developers.org/2011/08/flash-camp-italy-23-sept-2011/">Flex Camp in Rimini, Italy</a>.  On September 23, Mike Labriola and I will be doing two sessions.  First is "Planet of the AOPs" where we will show how Aspect Oriented Programming can be implemented in Flex using runtime bytecode modification.  Mike and I will also be doing a little "Flex Puzzlers" session where you will discover some very peculiar things about Flex and Flash Player.  It's going to be a blast and I hope to see you there!  Also, there will be a raffle for a copy of Creative Suite 5.5 and a Playbook.  So go <a href="http://flashcampitaly.eventbrite.com/">sign up NOW</a>!
