It's been four months since I started working at Heroku as a Developer Evangelist.  Now it is clear to me that I got really lucky.  Heroku is a top-notch place to work.  The product is sexy.  The people are all rock stars.  Heroku is owned by Salesforce.com so there is the stability of a large company but the start-up culture remains in place.

Heroku is looking to hire <a href="http://jobs.heroku.com/">lots of people (engineers, marketing, etc)</a> but of particular interest to my readers might be the <a href="http://heroku.theresumator.com/apply/F1VGjh/Java-Developer-Evangelist.html">Java Developer Evangelist</a> position.  Come work with me to help educate Java developers about Heroku!

BTW: Check out how the application asks for your GitHub URL.  I love this place!
