In a few weeks I'll be in Ann Arbor, MI to lead a <a href="http://flexjam2011.eventbrite.com/">Flex Jam</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.srtsolutions.com/">SRT Solutions</a>.  Code Jams give you the opportunity to learn by doing.  So bring your laptop and come join us in Ann Arbor!

Here is the full description of the event:
Join SRT Solutions as we host James Ward, Adobe Flex evangelist, from Tuesday, February 15 through Thursday February 17 for 3 interactive days of Flex (and AIR) development and exploration.  Jams, pioneered by Bruce Eckel and modeled after sessions that bring musicians together to create something new and interesting, take learning beyond the lecture/lab process.  The lecture/lab learning works best for groups where everyone is at the same level.  By bringing together developers of varying skill levels with a technology, the Jam process allows everyone to work at their own level.
Experienced Flex developers: bring problems of your own to work on, with the guidance of James Ward.
New or limited experience Flex developers: bring examples of problems to try, or work on the examples provided.
