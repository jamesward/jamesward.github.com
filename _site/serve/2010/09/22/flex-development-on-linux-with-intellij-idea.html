It's kinda hard to believe that I've been doing Flex development on Linux for over six years now.  In that time I've tried a few different tools.  Vim will always be my favorite but debugging is painful.  <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/flexbuilder_linux/">Flex Builder for Linux</a> worked but lacked major features and commitment from Adobe for continual improvement.  Most recently I've been using <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> for Flex development on Linux.  It's been working great!  There are a few things I've had to get used to but they are doing a great job of providing superb tooling support for Flex.  I've also been very impressed with the responsiveness from the IntelliJ team in their <a href="http://devnet.jetbrains.net/community/idea/ideacommunity?view=discussions">forums</a> and <a href="http://youtrack.jetbrains.net/dashboard/IDEA#tab=0">bug system</a>.

Here is a quick video I recorded to show the basics of using IntelliJ IDEA for Flex development on Linux:

To get started download either the <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/IDEADEV/IDEA+X+EAP">latest prerelease of IntelliJ IDEA</a> or their <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html">current production version</a>.  Flex development is only available in their Ultimate Edition but they do provide a free 30 day trial.  Let me know what you think.
