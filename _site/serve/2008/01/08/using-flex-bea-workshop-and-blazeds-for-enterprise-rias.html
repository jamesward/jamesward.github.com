One of the most exciting Flex-related announcements in 2007 was the BEA Workshop and Flex Builder bundle.  In case you missed it you can find coverage <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/09/11/bea-adobe_1.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201805630">here</a>, <a href="http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=pr01850.htm&FP=/content/news_events/press_releases/2007">here</a>, and a bunch of other places.  It was big news!  This was further validation that Flex is the standard for Enterprise Rich Internet Applications.

They build solid software that is the backbone of many large and mission critical systems.  Their stuff just works.  And their development tools are no different.

When we first began meeting with BEA about Flex it became evident very quickly how well the two technology sets fit together.

Flex Builder + Workshop = Amazing tooling for Enterprise RIAs

With BlazeDS the stack gets even better.

BlazeDS + Weblogic = Solid back-end for Enterprise RIAs

But how do you fit all these pieces together?  An article I wrote was recently published on just this:

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/bea_workshop.html">Using BEA Workshop Studio and Java to create Flex-based RIAs</a>
<br/>
(Note: I used Tomcat instead of Weblogic in the article so that there wasn't one more prerequisite for readers to download.  However the steps to use Weblogic are identical - just setup a Weblogic server instead of a Tomcat server.)

I hope that this combination of technologies allows you to build some amazing applications!  Let me know how it goes.
