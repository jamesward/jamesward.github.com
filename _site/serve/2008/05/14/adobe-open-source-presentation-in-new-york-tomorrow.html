Tomorrow night I'll be presenting at the New York GNU/Linux Meetup Group about Adobe Open Source - including the Adobe Flex SDK, Mozilla Tamarin, Adobe AIR (pieces like SQLite and WebKit), and BlazeDS.  More details <a href="http://linux.meetup.com/392/calendar/7593094/">here</a>.  Hope to see you there!
