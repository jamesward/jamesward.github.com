At JavaOne 2008 the daily edition of "JavaOne Today" features an interview with Sun's Tor Norbye saying "Java and the Flex SDK are both open sourced.  I hope they both benefit from community involvement at whatever level people choose to get involved."

Funny thing is that this is actually a quote from <a href="http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/">Chet Haase</a> of Adobe which was featured in yesterday's JavaOne Today.  Whoops.

See a picture from Tor's interview below.
