One of the "problems" with using Flex so much is that I get used to having a simple, predictable layout mechanism.  I seem to have forgotten how to do just about anything in HTML.  So can someone help me fix the Digg, Reddit, and Share This stuff below?  I've tried and tried and can't figure out how to get the dang things to align correctly.  Ideally they would align to the bottom of a div or something.  Gosh it's really embarrassing admitting publicly that I can't do HTML anymore.  But since you have already seen how bad this blog looks, you probably already guessed that.  :)  Oh well.  Please help.
