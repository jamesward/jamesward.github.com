Today is the last day you will be able to get the early bird discount on the <a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/FlexAIRJam/Index.php">Flex/AIR Jam</a> and <a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/RIA/Index.php">RIA Summit</a> conferences in Crested Butte.  Also, attendees of the Flex/AIR Jam will get a free copy of Flex Builder!  The Jam will be a fantastic way to learn how to use or extend your knowledge of Flex and AIR.  Bring your laptop and spend two days of hands-on, coached coding.  The RIA Summit will be a three day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_meeting">Open Space</a> style event focused on discussion about Rich Internet Applications.  I've been to events run by Bruce Eckel in Crested Butte before.  They are the best events I've been to and highly recommend them.  Go sign up today to get the early bird discount.  I hope to see you there!
