*** WARNING - THIS IS TOTALLY UNSUPPORTED, UNENDORSED, AND A COMPLETE HACK ***

I tried for a while to get the actual Adobe AIR runtime installed via wine on Linux.  But I wasn't able to get it to work.  Then I realized that I don't really need the whole runtime to just test my AIR applications.  All I need is ADL - the testing tool for AIR applications.  So I gave it a try on a Salesforce.com project I'm working on:

<code>jamesw@dos:~/projects/mavericks/examples/air/AccountTracker/bin$ wine ~/flex_sdk-3_b1/bin/adl.exe salesforceTest-app.xml</code>

And to my total surprise the AIR application loaded and ran on Linux!  Sweet!
