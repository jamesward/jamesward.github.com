I am usually on Linux when I develop Flex applications and I recently discovered a cool trick that makes development even easier.  Use Epiphany as the browser you run / test your applications in instead of Firefox.  Here's a few reasons:
- If Epiphany crashes because your app goes crazy it doesn't take your normal browser and all its sessions down with it.
- Epiphany uses inotify or a file watch and automatically refreshes when your application changes.  It saves quite a bit of time to have the application already loaded before I can even switch to my browser.
- Flash works the same in Epiphany as it does in any other browser.

I hope others find this useful.
