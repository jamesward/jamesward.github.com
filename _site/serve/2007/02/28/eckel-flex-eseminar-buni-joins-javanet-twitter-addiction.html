Yesterday was an exciting day!  Bruce Eckel and I hosted an eSeminar about Flex & Java.  We had a few technical difficulties, but overall it was very good.  You can watch the recording here:

Also yesterday the Open Source <a href="http://www.buni.org/mediawiki/index.php/Meldware_Communications_Suite">Buni Meldware Communication Suite</a> joined the <a href="https://meldware.dev.java.net/">Java.net</a> community.  This is a great step forward for the project, which uses Flex for it's Webmail client.  More info from Andy Oliver:
