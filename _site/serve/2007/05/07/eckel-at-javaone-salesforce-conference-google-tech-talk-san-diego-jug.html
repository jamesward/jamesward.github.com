There's so much fun stuff going on it's hard to keep my blog up-to-date.  But I did want to note a couple of things...

<a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=193593">Bruce Eckel</a> will be at JavaOne!  He will spend some time in the Adobe booth and some time at various sessions.  But the big news is that he and I will be co-presenting a short session before the Adobe Party on Wednesday night.  This will be a fun thirty minute session that will be entertaining and educational.  Too bad this isn't an official JavaOne session, but I guess Sun doesn't want me presenting about Flex at JavaOne (They rejected my three submissions but possibly for other reasons.)  Following the short session will be the party.  Food, drinks, and hanging out with Bruce Eckel!  Stop by the Adobe booth at JavaOne to get your official invitation (which I think you will need to get in).

There is a <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/campaigns/developerconference/">free Salesforce conference</a> coming up on May 21st.  I'll be co-presenting a session on the <a href="http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Flex_Toolkit">Flex Toolkit for Apex</a>.  This will be a great session for anyone who wants to build sexy apps with Flex and Apollo on top of Salesforce.  For those who haven't yet tried out the Apex Toolkit you really should attend this session.  You know how you usually have to setup a database, maintain it, write lots of middleware code, maintain that, etc?  Well with Salesforce you don't really have to do that.  You use the customizable Salesforce back-end and build your sexy Flex front-end.  It couldn't be easier to build enterprise apps that are maintainable and sexy!  Come to the conference and learn more!

This past week Dick Wall of the <a href="http://www.javaposse.com">Java Posse</a> invited me to do a Google Tech Talk.  The session was recorded and <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1156113143758326102&hl=en">posted on Google Video</a>.  Thanks Dick (and Google) for inviting me!  I had a great time!

Next week on May 15th I'll be presenting at the <a href="http://www.sdjug.com/">San Diego JUG</a>.  If you are in the area I'd love to meet you in person.

That's all for now.  I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at JavaOne this week!
