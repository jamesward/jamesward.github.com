Bruce Eckel and I will be hosting a 3 day <a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/FlexAIRJam/Index.php">Adobe AIR and Flex Jam</a> in Crested Butte, Colorado - February 25 - 27.  If you are learning Flex or diving deeper into Flex then this will be a great opportunity to quickly learn more.  For beginners we will work through our book <a href="http://www.firststepsinflex.com">First Steps in Flex</a>.  Hopefully see you there!
