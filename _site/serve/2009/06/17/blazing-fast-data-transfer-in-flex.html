A while back I created the <a href="/census/">Census RIA Benchmark</a> to illustrate the benefits of having both a high performance client VM and a binary serialization protocol.  These factors combined lead to significantly faster data transfer and rendering for large datasets in rich Internet applications.  Recently I created an Adobe TV video that walks through Census and how to use Flex and BlazeDS to take advantage of these benefits.  Check it out and let me know what you think.

Note: If you run Census in Firefox 3 there is a bug with iframes causing the tests to not run until you click on the results panel on the right.
