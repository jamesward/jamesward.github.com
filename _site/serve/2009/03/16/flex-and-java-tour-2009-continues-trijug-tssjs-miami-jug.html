I'll be at the <a href="http://trijug.org/meetinginfo.jsp?date=2009-03">TriJUG</a> tonight talking about integrating Flex and Java in real-world applications.

On Wednesday March 18th I'll be speaking at <a href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/html/frameworks.html#JWardFlex">TheServerSide Java Symposium</a> in Vegas.

And on March 24th I'll be speaking in Miami at the <a href="http://miamijug.wordpress.com/2009/03/06/march-meeting/">Miami JUG</a>.

Hope to see some of you along the way!
