On Thursday December 17th I'll be doing an eSeminar about Salesforce.com and the Adobe Flash Platform.  This is a great opportunity to learn more about how to build Flex RIAs on the Cloud using the new Flash Builder for Force.com tool.  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=1489921&loc=en_us">Sign up and see more details</a>.  Hope to see you there!
