Next week I'm off to a few more Java User Groups to talk about Flex and Java integration:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pjug.org/">Portland - April 21st</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cinjug.org/">Cincinnati - April 23rd</a></li>
</ul>

Also while I'm in Portland I'll be speaking on April 22nd at the PDX RIA User Group about "<a href="http://groups.adobe.com/posts/ab210e915d">Super fast, multi-threaded, number crunching in Flash</a>".

I hope to see some of you along the way!
