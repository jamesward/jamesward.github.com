I recently <a href="http://java.dzone.com/podcasts/james_ward_flex_air_java">recorded a podcast</a> with James Sugrue for DZone.  In the podcast we talk about why Flex and Adobe AIR are relevant to Java developers.  You can either listen to <a href="http://java.dzone.com/podcasts/james_ward_flex_air_java">the podcast</a> or read transcribed text.  It's good to see DZone doing a lot more Flex related content including the Refcardz I've co-authored: <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/very-first-steps-flex">Very First Steps in Flex</a> and <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/flex-spring-integration">Flex and Spring Integration</a>.

Let me know what you think of the podcast.  Thanks!
