Back in August at the <a href="http://www.codetown.us/profiles/blogs/flex-jam-in-orlando-with-james">Flex Jam in Orlando</a> one of the projects we worked on was Text to Speech in Flex.  We didn't finish the project at the Jam so I wanted to post the final version here.  Check it out:

(<a href="http://www.jamesward.com/demos/iSpeechDemo/srcview/index.html">source code</a>)

I used the <a href="http://www.ispeech.org/api">iSpeech.org API</a> to convert the text to speech.  It was pretty easy to build this demo but a production version would need to use a proxy so that the username and password can't be discovered.

Let me know what you think.
