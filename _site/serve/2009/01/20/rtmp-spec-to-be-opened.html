A little over a year ago Adobe opened the <a href="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/amf/amf3_spec_121207.pdf">AMF spec</a>.  Now Adobe <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200901/012009RTMP.html">has announced</a> it will be opening the RTMP spec!  Wahoo!!!  This is big news for Flex developers!  For those that don't know, RTMP is the streaming protocol used for streaming video and audio in Flash Media Server and for streaming data in LiveCycle Data Services.  The spec is expected to be published first half of this year.
