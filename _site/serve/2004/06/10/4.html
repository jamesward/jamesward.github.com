Yesterday Mozilla released <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.9rc">Firefox 0.9 rc1</a> and I just couldn't wait any longer for the ebuild, so I figured out how to get it built from the cvs source.  The instructions are posted on the <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=183733">Gentoo Forums</a>.  Not a big deal, but I thought this was blog worthy since it was fun and exciting.  I guess that makes me a nerd.  :)
