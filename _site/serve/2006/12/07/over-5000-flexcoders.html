I just noticed that the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/search?query=flexcoders">flexcoders Yahoo! Group</a> now has over 5000 members!  That's pretty amazing!  This list was founded almost 3 years ago on March 17, 2004.  But my <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/flexcoders/message/8291">first post</a> wasn't until January 17, 2005.  So I am but a newbie.  Congrats to all those early founders who started the revolution and have continued answering questions for years and years.  A special shout-out to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mdowney/212801231/">Matt Chotin</a> who has posted 3407 messages!  Wow!
