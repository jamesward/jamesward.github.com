Just a quick note that tomorrow (October 12, 2010) I'll be presenting a session at the <a href="http://camp.rmaug.com/">Rocky Mountain Flash Camp</a> on <a href="http://camp.rmaug.com/sessions/descriptions#jward">Mobile Flash & Flex Development</a>.  It's going to be super fun!  Hope to see you there.
