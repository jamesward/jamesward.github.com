This week in Denver is going to be a total geek fest!  I'm pretty excited about three great events:
<ul>
<li>Monday Feb 15: <a href="http://agiledenver.ning.com/events/jason-huggins-on">Jason Huggins on Web-application testing with Selenium</a></li>
<li>Tuesday Feb 16: <a href="http://denvertechmeetup.com/2010/02/04/get-primed-up-for-fat-tuesday-at-this-months-meeting/">Denver Tech Meetup</a></li>
<li>Thursday Feb 18: <a href="http://ria5280.org/calendar/event/2010/2/18/163821">Flex and The Cloud</a> (I'm presenting at this one.)</li>
</ul>

There is a rumor that we might record a <a href="http://www.drunkonsoftware.com">Drunk on Software</a> episode after the event on Thursday.  Apparently there are some people who disagree with my definition of "Flex app".  This could be the episode where we move from an Oprah style show to a Jerry Springer style of show.  Sounds like fun to me.  :)
