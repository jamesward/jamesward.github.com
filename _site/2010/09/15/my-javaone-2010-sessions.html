Next week at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/javaonedevelop/index.html">JavaOne 2010</a> I'll be co-presenting two sessions!  On Monday <a href="http://twitter.com/jeremyg484">Jeremy Grelle</a> and I will present "<strong>End-to-End Richness: Integrating Java EE Services to Create Engaging RIAs</strong>" at the Hilton San Francisco.  Here is the session information:
Session ID: S313939 
Abstract: Flex is one of the most widely used tools for building RIAs. But how do you efficiently connect applications to diverse back-end services built on Java EE? The Spring BlazeDS Integration project has emerged as an effective solution for building a lightweight connective tissue for exposing rich Java EE services to a Flex client from any Java Servlet container. Aimed at experienced Java developers who want to make maximum use of their knowledge of Spring and Java EE to build a compelling integrated experience, this session covers:
<ul>
<li>Connecting services built with Spring and Java EE APIs (JPA, JMS, JAX-WS, and JAX-RS) to a Flex client</li>
<li>Using DI techniques to configure and expose RPC and pub/sub endpoints</li>
<li>Applying a rich security model</li>
</ul>
Time and Location: Monday, September 20, 16:00 | Hilton San Francisco, Golden Gate 3

On Thursday <a href="http://gregsramblings.com/">Greg Wilson</a> and I will be present "<strong>Making Real-Time Data Come Alive</strong>".  Here is the session information:
Session ID: S313543
Abstract: Using a combination of Java, JMS, and Flash, data can be visualized in real time on a client. Real-time visualizations can be in dashboards, heat maps, charts, and numerous other interactive controls. Intended for developers looking to create applications with real-time data visualizations, this session will show how to set up a system that pushes real-time messages to a client from a Java EE server and how to create a rich internet application that renders the data. It will demonstrate how to:
<ul>
<li>Configure a Java EE system that can push JMS messages to a client in real-time or near real-time</li>
<li>Build a Flash client application that renders data from the server</li>
<li>Connect a client to messages using HTTP Streaming and HTTP Long Polling</li>
</ul>
Time and Location: Thursday, September 23, 15:30 | Parc 55, Cyril Magnin II

If you are at JavaOne then I hope to see you at one of these sessions!
