Adobe's Enterprise Evangelism team including <a href="http://gregsramblings.com">Greg Wilson</a>, <a href="http://coenraets.org">Christophe Coenraets</a>, and myself are in Tampa, FL this week.  On Thursday night we are <a href="http://gregsramblings.com/2010/01/18/tampa-bay-adobe-developer-event-this-thursday/">rounding up the local geeks</a> at Taverna Opa for free beers and drunken confabulation about Flex, The Flash Platform, and other topics that bore most normal people.  Hope to see you there!
