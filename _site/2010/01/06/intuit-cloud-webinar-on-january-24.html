Intuit's Cloud / Platform as a Service (PaaS) technology called the Intuit Partner Platform (IPP) has quickly matured into a first class Client + Cloud solution.  Building a custom user interface with IPP is done through Flex.  This is a perfect combination and opens many opportunities for developers to build and sell apps into Intuit's extensive ecosystem.  They are doing a <a href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/152420656">Webinar on January 14</a> about what's new in IPP v2.4.  This is a great opportunity to learn more about how you can build apps for the IPP with Flex.  Definitely a session not to miss!
