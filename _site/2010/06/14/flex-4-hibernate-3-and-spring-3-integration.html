<a href="http://ectropic.com">Jon Rose</a> and I have created a new <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/">DZone Refcard</a> called <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/flex-4-and-spring-3">Flex 4 and Spring 3 Integration</a>.  In the Refcard, we walk you through the steps for building RIAs with Flash Builder 4, Flex 4, BlazeDS 4, Spring 3, the Spring BlazeDS Integration, and Hibernate.  Whew!  That's a lot of pieces!  The Refcard covers simple Remoting, Flex & Hibernate integration through Spring (all Java annotation driven and using the new data-centric development features in Flash Builder 4), Pub / Sub Messaging, and Flex and Spring Security.  We pack a lot into six pages!
