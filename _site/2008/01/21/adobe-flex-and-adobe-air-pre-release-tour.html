Today I leave for Europe where I will kick off my first few stops on the <a href="http://flex.org/tour">Adobe Flex and Adobe AIR Pre-Release Tour</a> - Paris, Milan, London, Amsterdam, and Brussels.  Then next week I take a week off the tour to speak at the <a href="http://tampajug.org/">Tampa Java User Group</a>.  The following week I resume the tour in the Midwest - Minneapolis, Chicago, Kansas City, and St Louis.  Find out more details about the tour at: <a href="http://www.flex.org/tour">flex.org/tour</a>

I'm looking forward to meeting more of the Flex community over the next few weeks and hopefully you! (If you happen to live near any of those locations.)
