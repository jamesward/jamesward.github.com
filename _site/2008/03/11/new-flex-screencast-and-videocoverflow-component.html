For the Flex 2 product pages on adobe.com I recorded a screencast of <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2006/11/14/screencast-watch-a-flex-app-built-in-11-minutes/">a Flex app being built in 11 minutes</a>.  For Flex 3 I recorded <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/media/flexapp/">a new version of that screencast</a>.  In the new version I used <a href="http://dougmccune.com/blog/2007/11/19/flex-coverflow-performance-improvement-flex-carousel-component-and-vertical-coverflow/">Doug McCune's CoverFlow component</a> but extended it to easily support playing videos.  Check out <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/myTube/myTube.html">a demo of the VideoCoverFlow component</a> and right-click to download the <a href="/myTube/srcview/index.html">source code</a>.  For those trying to use the VideoCoverFlow component - the implementation has changed slightly since I recorded the screencast so check out the myTube application for an example of how to use it.

Thanks Doug for the CoverFlow component.
