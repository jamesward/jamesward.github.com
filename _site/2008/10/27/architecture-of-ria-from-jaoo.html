At the <a href="http://jaoo.dk/aarhus-2008/conference/">JAOO</a> conference in Aarhus, Denmark I was able to co-present with <a href="http://www.joshholmes.com">Josh Holmes</a> from Microsoft about the Architecture of RIA.  This presentation was technology agnostic so we didn't talk about specific implementations using platforms like Flex / Flash or Silverlight.  Josh has posted the presentation slides and detailed notes on his blog:

Check it out and let us know what you think.
