On a recent dreary Saturday afternoon in Denver my friend <a href="http://www.ectropic.com">Jon Rose</a> and I decided to give the video podcasting thing a try.  The <a href="http://www.drunkonsoftware.com/2008/10/21/episode-1-flash-player-10-for-developers/">first episode</a> is about the changes to the recently released Flash Player 10 that will impact software developers (primarily those of the Flex persuasion).  When preparing to record the interview we decided to break out the Glenlivet.  One thing led to another and somehow we came up with the name "Drunk on Software" as a cheap ripoff of the popular "Joel on Software" blog.  But don't worry...  Even though some episodes will involve drinking they will hopefully be coherent and useful.  In the future we will be interviewing the smart people we know in the Denver area (or wherever Jon and I happen to be).  So if you'd be interested in being interviewed and can handle being barraged with questions while we drink fine liquor, please let us know!
