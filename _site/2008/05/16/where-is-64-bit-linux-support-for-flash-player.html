I run 32-bit Linux but there is a very vocal group of people who really want 64-bit Linux support for Flash Player.  Today there is a decent work around for running the 32-bit Flash Player on a 64-bit Linux system using the <a href="http://gwenole.beauchesne.info/en/projects/nspluginwrapper">nspluginwrapper</a>.  From what I've heard it works fairly well on most distro's but I haven't heard yet how well it works with the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/">new Flash Player 10 beta</a>.  Despite this potential work around eventually Adobe does need to natively support 64-bit Linux - and they will.  This is not as simple as a recompile - otherwise there would be 64-bit support today.  There is <a href="https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-37">a bug already filed</a> in the public Flash Player bug database for 64-bit support.  I'd encourage you to not just go vote for that bug but also to get involved.  As <a href="http://www.kaourantin.net/">Tinic Uro</a> points out in the bug comments, the missing piece for 64-bit support is open source - so you can help!  Flash Player uses the open source <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/">Mozilla Tamarin VM</a>.  This VM does not yet support 64-bit Linux because all that machine code generation in the JIT compiler needs to be ported from 32-bit to 64-bit.  The code is in <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/tamarin-central/">Mozilla's Tamarin Central Mercurial repo</a>.  This IS open source!  You can help get 64-bit Linux support for Flash Player!
