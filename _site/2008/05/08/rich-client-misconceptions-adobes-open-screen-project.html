<a href="http://artima.com">Artima</a> recently posted two interviews with me which relate to Flex.  First is an interview about <a href="http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=270&thread=230045">Adobe's Open Screen Project</a>.  The second is called <a href="http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/javaone_2008_james_ward.html">Rich-Client Misconceptions</a>.  Also Bruce Eckel recently posted a very interesting article on Artima called "<a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=230001">Concurrency with Python, Twisted, and Flex</a>".  Let me know what you think about those.
