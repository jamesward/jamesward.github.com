Over the past few months <a href="http://gregsramblings.com/">Greg Wilson</a>, <a href="http://coenraets.org/">Christophe Coenraets</a>, and myself have been hard at work on a secret project.  So today we are proud to announce the new <a href="http://flex.org/tour">Tour de Flex</a> has just gone live!  Tour de Flex showcases the capabilities of Flex, BlazeDS, LCDS, Adobe AIR, and Flash Player (now collectively called the Adobe Flash Platform).

Like the old <a href="http://examples.adobe.com/flex3/componentexplorer/explorer.html">Flex Component Explorer</a>, Tour de Flex can be used to find components.  But it goes way beyond just out-of-the-box Flex components.  This first release contains 217 components and samples including popular Cloud APIs like <a href="http://developer.salesforce.com">Salesforce.com</a> and <a href="http://developer.intuit.com">Intuit</a>, numerous community components from people like <a href="http://dougmccune.com/blog/">Doug McCune</a> and <a href="http://tink.ws/blog/">Tink</a>, commercial components from companies like <a href="http://www.ilog.com/products/elixir/">ILog</a>, and numerous other goodies.  If you find something missing you can <a href="http://flex.org/2008/10/31/submit-component-tour-de-flex">submit it</a>!

Also in this release is an Eclipse / Flex Builder plugin which allows you to find components from inside Flex Builder!

We hope the Tour de Flex will provide an easy way for you to find components and see what is great about the Adobe Flash Platform.  Give it a try and let us know what you think!
