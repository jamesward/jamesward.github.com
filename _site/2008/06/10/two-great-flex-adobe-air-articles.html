Just a quick note about two great articles which were recently published:

<a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=230610">ActionScript Collections and Functional Programming</a> by Bruce Eckel
In this article Bruce provides examples and insights into the functional pieces of ActionScript. He also covers some of the lesser known things about Collections.  I learned quite a bit from this one!

<a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/nasdaq-case-study-air-and-s3">InfoQ Case Study: NASDAQ Market Replay</a>
Jon Rose worked with NASDAQ to create a great case study about using Adobe AIR, Flex, and Amazon S3.
