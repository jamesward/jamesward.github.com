I've gone commercial.  Kinda.  I just bought jamesward.com and it is now my primary domain name instead of jamesward.org.  I liked the .org URL but it's a less familiar URL to non-geeks.  You say .com and everyone knows what you mean.  The .org will still work - redirects right to here.

So I'm a sell-out.  Gone .com.  Good news is that you still won't see any ads on my site.

Let me know if you have any problems with the new domain.
