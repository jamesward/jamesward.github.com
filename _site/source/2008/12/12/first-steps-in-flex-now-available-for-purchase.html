It was a great privilege to work on this book with <a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Index.php">Bruce Eckel</a>.  Much of my foundation in OO programming came from reading Bruce's <a href="http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/">Thinking in Java</a> book.  Writing about Flex with him is like an amateur golfer being able to play a round with Tiger Woods.  Luckily Bruce is patient and willing to teach novices like myself.  Starting with a short book was a good way for me to begin learning about the process of writing books as well as learn about the significant time commitment required to finish a book.  While First Steps in Flex is only 140 pages, I now have a much greater appreciation for those who have written much larger technical books!

Bruce and I enjoyed the experience of writing together but we couldn't have polished the book without the help from a number of very helpful reviewers.  I'm very thankful for those of you who helped review the book and test all of the code!

Writings was a great experience - one that I might try again.  Please let us know what you think of the book!  We hope that what we have created will allow many developers to take those First Steps in Flex!
