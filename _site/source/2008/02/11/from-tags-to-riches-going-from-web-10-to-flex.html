An article titled "<a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/web-flex-port">From Tags to Riches: Going from Web 1.0 to Flex</a>" which I co-authored with <a href="http://www.shanky.org/">Shashank Tiwari</a> has been <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/web-flex-port">published on InfoQ</a>.  In the article, Shashank and I walk through the steps needed to port a traditional HTML-based application to Flex.  We use the Java-based <a href="http://www.pentaho.org/">Pentaho BI Dashboard</a> as our example application.  Our goal in writing the article was to make the process easy for anyone to try on their own. It should be easy to try it yourself -- just download the code and other necessary pieces.  Also, if you want to play with the end result, you can access the Flex application <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/pentaho_dashboard/pentaho_dashboard_demo.html">here</a>.  Let us know what you think.

[Update: Shashank's <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2008/02/from_tags_to_riches_going_from.html">blog post about the article</a> made me realize that I forgot to mention I will be presenting on this topic at <a href="http://www.jbossworld.com/agenda/thursday.html#next_thurs_10">JBoss World</a> this week but using the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JMXConsole">JBoss JMX Console</a> as the example application.  Thanks Shashank for including that!]
