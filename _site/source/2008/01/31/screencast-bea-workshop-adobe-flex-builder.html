Pieter Humphrey of BEA has posted <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/e/1165">a great screencast</a> about using the BEA Workshop / Flex Builder bundle.  He goes through a very in-depth demonstration of using all the great features of Workshop and Flex to build a RIA front-end for the Medrec Patient Application.  Definitely worth watching!  Thanks Pieter for posting that!
