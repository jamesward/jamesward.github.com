Jon and I have posted <a href="http://www.drunkonsoftware.com/2008/11/20/episode-3-performance-pitfalls-of-flexs-arraycollection/">Episode 3</a> of the Drunk on Software video podcast.  In this episode we talk about some of the real world performance issues with Flex's ArrayCollection.  We've also created a few demos which illustrate how in some cases ArrayCollection is 26 times slower than Array:
