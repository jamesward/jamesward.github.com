In a few weeks I'll be stopping by the Atlanta Java User Group and the Chicago Flex and AIR Developers Group:

Atlanta - August 19, 2008 - <a href="http://www.ajug.org/confluence/display/AJUG/Home">Rich Internet Applications with Flex and Java</a>

Chicago - August 20, 2008 - <a href="http://chicagoflex.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=63:next-meeting-wed-82008-530-pm&catid=45:upcoming&Itemid=68">The Future of Flex, Flash Player, and AIR</a>

Hope to see you there!
