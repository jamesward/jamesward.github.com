In a few weeks I'll be speaking in Atlanta at <a href="http://www.devnexus.com/">DevNexus</a> and at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/atlflex">Atlanta Flex User Group</a>.  On March 21, 2011 at DevNexus I have two sessions:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.devnexus.com/s/presentations#1156">AS34J - ActionScript for Java Developers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.devnexus.com/s/presentations#1155">Rapid Mobile & Tablet App Development with Spring and Flex</a></li>
</ul>
On March 22, 2011 at the Atlanta Flex User Group I will be presenting about <a href="http://www.meetup.com/atlflex/events/16734337/">Flex 4.5 - The Non-Mobile New Features</a>.

I hope to see you at DevNexus and at the Atlanta Flex User Group!
