Next week I begin a Java User Group tour where I'll be talking about integrating Flex with Java, Spring, and Hibernate.  First stop is the <a href="http://www.phxjug.org/meetings.html#next">Phoenix JUG</a> on Wednesday March 11.  Then I'll be at the <a href="http://www.ocjug.org/presos/abstract.jsp?id=81">Orange County JUG</a> on Thursday March 12.

I'll be at a number of other JUGs over the next few months.  I hope to see you along the way!
