While I was attending the Java Posse Roundup 2009 I was able to give a 5-minute Lightning Talk about Flex.  There are now so many amazing things to show with Flex that it's really hard to narrow down what will be the most compelling.  In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUaM9CADiU&feature=channel_page">past years</a> I showed more code and useful things.  But this year I wanted to just make people's jaws drop.

First I showed the <a href="http://flex.org/tour">Tour de Flex</a> application to encourage all of the attendees to go explore some great Flex components on their own.  I also wanted to show off the new 3D APIs in Flash Player 10 so I showed Justin Everett Church's <a href="http://justin.everett-church.com/fp10demos/cloth.html">Cloth Demo</a>.  Then I showed a prototype of an Adobe AIR based catalog for the Anthropologie women's clothing store.

At the end I really wanted to WOW everyone so I showed some of the <a href="http://www.libspark.org/wiki/saqoosha/FLARToolKit/en">FLARToolkit</a> <a href="http://flash.tarotaro.org/blog/">demos</a> followed by a custom application that I built using the FLARToolkit.  The application I built scrolls up and down in a datagrid using the position of a marker which is being captured by the web cam.  It's hard to explain so you will just have to check out the video.  Let me know what you think.
