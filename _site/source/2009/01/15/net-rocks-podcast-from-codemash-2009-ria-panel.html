At <a href="http://www.codemash.org">CodeMash 2009</a> I was able to participate in a panel discussion about Rich Internet Applications, Flex, Silverlight, and Ajax.  The panel was moderated by Richard and Carl from the <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com">.NET Rocks! podcast</a>.  Also on the panel was <a href="http://joshholmes.com/">Josh Holmes</a> and <a href="http://silverlight.net/blogs/jesseliberty/">Jesse Liberty</a> from Microsoft and <a href="http://www.fallenrogue.com/">Leon Gersing</a>.  It was a fun panel - especially since we enjoyed some fine whiskey during it! But also because it's great to see how we all have common goals - we all want software to be better no matter what the underlying technology is.

In case you weren't at CodeMash you can <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=412">listen to the recording from .Net Rocks!</a> and then let me know what you think.
