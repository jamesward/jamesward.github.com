If you have a technical question that is unrelated to one of my blog posts, then here is what to do...  If that question is specific to you and no one else in the developer community, then email me at jaward at adobe dot com (obfuscated to avoid spam).  I will respond to your email but response times can greatly fluctuate.  If you have a more general technical question that pertains to the broader developer community then do the following (this option will usually yield a response within hours):
<ol>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask">Ask a Question</a> on StackOverflow.com</li>
<li>Post a comment here with a link to the question</li>
<li>Wait for me or someone else on StackOverflow to respond</li>
</ol>
