On Saturday, March 28th, 2009 there will be a huge gathering of Flex gurus to quash some of the open source Flex SDK bugs!  You can participate either in person (currently only in Seattle but there's no reason why we can't add more locations!) or over the Internet.  More information is available at: <a href="http://www.bugquash.com/">www.bugquash.com</a>
