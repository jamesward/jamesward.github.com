The current <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flexbuilder_linux.html">alpha version</a> of Flex Builder on Linux doesn't have feature parity with the Windows and Mac versions of Flex Builder.  It is scheduled to timeout on December 1, 2009 and current development <a href="http://gruchalski.com/2009/04/22/flex-builder-3-for-linux-on-hold/">seems to be on hold</a>.  If you would like to see Adobe create a full version of Flex Builder for Linux then please go vote for <a href="http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FB-19053">feature request #FB-19053</a>!  Thanks!
