One of the things that is available in HTML web pages but usually left out of Flex applications is the ability to save images by right-clicking on them.  This is not because it's not possible with Flex - rather it just requires a little extra coding.  So I created a simple Flex example that adds the "Save Image As" right-click menu item.  Check out the <a href="/saveAsImage/saveAsImage.html">demo</a> and the <a href="/saveAsImage/srcview/">source code</a>.

This requires Flash Player 10 which allows users to save files generated at runtime on the client-side.  I couldn't find the ByteArray containing the original image file loaded by Flash Player so instead I had to read the bytes of the image wrapped in a SWF and slice out the image.  I'm not 100% sure that this trick will work for all image formats.  So give it a try and let me know what happens.
