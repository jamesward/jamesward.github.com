The second Flex application which Oracle demonstrated at Ed Abbo's keynote on Tuesday was Sales Library.  The Sales Library helps sales people organize and share their sales content.  The interface is very clean and elegant.  The transitions are smooth and useful.  Very impressive stuff!  Here is a photo of the Sales Library demo from Oracle OpenWorld (courtesy of Todd Ruhl):

Still one more Oracle Flex application left to announce.  Stay tuned.
