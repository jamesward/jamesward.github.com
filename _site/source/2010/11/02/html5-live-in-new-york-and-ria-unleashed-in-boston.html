I'll be speaking at two great events next week on the East Coast.  First up is <a href="http://html5live.org/html5-nyc-2010/">HTML5 Live</a> in New York on Tuesday November 9th.  At HTML5 Live I'll be talking about "<a href="http://html5live.org/html5-nyc-2010/presentation/Development+Tools+for+Building+HTML5+Content+%26+Applications">Development Tools for Building HTML5 Content &amp; Applications</a>".  Then on Friday November 12th I'll be at <a href="http://riaunleashed.com/">RIA Unleashed</a> in Boston talking about "<a href="http://riaunleashed.com/page.cfm/agenda">Flex 4.5 Hero</a>".  These two events will certainly be enlightening.  :)  I hope to see you there!
