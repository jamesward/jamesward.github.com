Two great Flex conferences have recently posted their video recordings:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://flexandair.blip.tv/">Flex Camp Wall Street</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vmware.webex.com/vmware/lsr.php?AT=pb&SP=MC&rID=38584082&rKey=fcadadcb421a0b9d">Flex on the Cloud</a></li>
</ul>

There were numerous great sessions and speakers at each of these conferences.  At Flex Camp Wall Street I presented "Flex Stuff I am Excited About".  Check it out and let me know what you think.
