In <a href="http://www.drunkonsoftware.com/2010/04/02/episode-23-id-give-it-a-4-5-out-of-10/">Episode 23</a> we chat with <a href="http://adamflater.blogspot.com/">Adam Flater</a> and <a href="http://www.robrusher.com/">Rob Rusher</a> about some very controversial topics. Adam points out James’ wishful thinking when we discuss what defines something being a “Flex application”. <a href="http://www.ectropic.com">Jon</a> gets the award for best quote of the episode when we discuss Flex and its community. Things get fun as we discuss Silverlight and Flex differences. As we wrap up Jon rates the wonderful scotch we were drinking an 8 out of 10.
