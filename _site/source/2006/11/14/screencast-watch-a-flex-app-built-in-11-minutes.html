[Update: This screencast has been updated for Flex 3.  Read more about it <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2008/03/11/new-flex-screencast-and-videocoverflow-component/">here</a>.]

Many times I am asked "Where do I start learning about Flex?".  Most of the time I point them to <a href="http://flex.org" target="_blank">flex.org</a> as a starting point.  However it is often just easier to see the product in action.  So I recorded a screencast of me building a simple Flex app with Flex Builder.  Here it is:

I hope this is helpful to those of you new to Flex.  After you watch the screencast, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/openflextrial" target="_blank">download Flex Builder</a> and give it a try.  If you find yourself saying things like "Wow!  Coding is fun again!" or "I had no idea RIA programming was so easy!", Welcome to Flexland!  A few years ago I found myself in Flexland and to me it's like being in the mountains...  Once you are there, you never want to be anywhere else.  :)
