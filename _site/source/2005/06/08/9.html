Last night I created a simple WYSIWYG tool based on Flex, inspired in part by the <a href="http://www.zamples.com/">Zamples</a> idea of <a href="http://zamples.com/JspExplorer/samples/index.jsp">Live Code Examples</a>.  The goal is to do on-the-fly conversion of simple markup to Flash objects.  This code is particularly useful for environments where content management is seperate from the web application.  This is pretty basic and there may be better ways to do this, but I hadn't seen this done before so I took a stab at it.  Feel free to suggest improvements!

Here's the source code:

Let me know what you think!
