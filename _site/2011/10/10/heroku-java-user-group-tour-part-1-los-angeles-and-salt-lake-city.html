This week I'm starting a Java User Group tour where I'll be travelling to JUGs around the US (or maybe world).  On the tour I'll be giving a talk about <strong>Running Java, Play! and Scala Apps on the Cloud</strong>.  Here is the description:
<blockquote>Heroku is a Polyglot Cloud Application Platform that makes it easy to deploy Java, Play! and Scala apps on the cloud. Deployment is as simple as doing a "git push". This session will teach you how to instantly deploy and scale Java, Play! and Scala apps on Heroku.</blockquote>

I'm still scheduling JUGs but here are the first two I'll be doing:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lajug.org/index.html">Los Angeles JUG - October 11</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ujug.org/">Utah / Salt Lake City / Murray JUG - October 20</a></li>
</ul>

There will be more to come and if you'd like this talk at your local Java User Group, let your leader know and have them email me: jw &lt;at&gt; heroku &lt;dot&gt; com

Hopefully see you at your local JUG!
