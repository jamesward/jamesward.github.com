I had the great pleasure of being invited to be a guest speaker on the <a href="http://redmonk.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=285181">second RIA Weekly podcast</a> with <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/">Cot√© from RedMonk</a> and <a href="http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/">Ryan Stewart</a>.  In the podcast we discuss Oracle's recent move to Flex and RIA as well as Java and Flex.  Let me know what you think.
