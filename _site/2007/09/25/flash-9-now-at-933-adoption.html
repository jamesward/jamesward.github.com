Emmy Huang just <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/emmy/archives/2007/09/flash_player_9_9.cfm">posted a note</a> about the Flash adoption statistics as of September 2007.  Flash 9 is now at 93.3% adoption!  This is great news for Flex developers!  If you develop with Flex 2 or the upcoming Flex 3, 93.3% of your visitors can run your applications without any hassle of having to update Flash.  Now why haven't Sun and Microsoft published their statistics so that developers are able to compare the adoption of the different RIA platforms?
