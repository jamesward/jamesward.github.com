I love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a>.  I've been doing Flex development on Linux for about three years - mostly with vi.  But to be honest when building complex applications it is nice to have things like code hinting and integrated debugging.  I'm sure you *could* make vi do that with Flex but I am not brave enough to attempt to figure that out.  So I'm extremely excited that Adobe is releasing a version of Flex Builder for Linux!  You can download Flex Builder for Linux from the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/flexbuilder_linux/">labs.adobe.com</a> site right now!

Having Flex Builder for Linux really empowers us Linux geeks to easily build Rich Internet Applications.  Flex 2 & Flex 3 applications can run in the browser via Flash Player 9 which has been available for Linux for more than a year.  To run Flex applications as Desktop applications we need the Adobe Integrated Runtime, AIR.  Adobe AIR isn't yet available for Linux.  But I've been having pretty good success testing / debugging Flex based AIR applications on Linux over the past few weeks since I discovered that <a href="/wordpress/2007/09/13/testing-air-applications-on-linux/">you can use Wine and adl.exe to run AIR applications on Linux</a>.

This is great news for developers - especially developers that use Linux!  But do I miss vi?  I really do.  I really wish there were vi key bindings in Eclipse (and there probably is but I haven't found a project that does that yet).  Go give the new Flex Builder for Linux a try and let us know how it goes!  Please file bugs and feature requests on <a href="http://bugs.adobe.com/flex">the public Flex bug database</a>.
