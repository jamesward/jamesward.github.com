One of <a href="/wordpress/2007/07/24/tutorial-salesforcecom-on-air-with-flex-3/">my old blogs</a> has been turned into a full article on the Adobe Developer Connection and updated for Flex 3 Beta 2 &amp; Adobe AIR Beta 2:
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/flex_air_salesforce.html">Building an Adobe AIR application on salesforce.com with Flex 3</a>

Also a recording of the session that I hosted at Dreamforce has been posted on the Apex Developer Network:
<a href="http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Dreamforce07_Dev_Sessions">Make Your App *Bling*: Build Amazing Salesforce Apps Using Adobe Tech.</a> (click on "Apex &amp; Beyond" then scroll down to the session)

Lastly, in the next few weeks we will be releasing an update to the <a href="http://flex.org/salesforce">Flex Toolkit for Apex</a> which adds simple local caching for AIR applications.  More information as soon as we finishing implementing the basic CRUD functions.
