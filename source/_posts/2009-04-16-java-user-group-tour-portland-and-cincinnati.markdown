Next week I'm off to a few more Java User Groups to talk about Flex and Java
integration:

  * [Portland - April 21st](http://www.pjug.org/)
  * [Cincinnati - April 23rd](http://www.cinjug.org/)
  
Also while I'm in Portland I'll be speaking on April 22nd at the PDX RIA User
Group about "[Super fast, multi-threaded, number crunching in
Flash](http://groups.adobe.com/posts/ab210e915d)".

I hope to see some of you along the way!
