This Thursday night you can meet the Flex team at the SF Adobe office.  Come and hang out with the people who actually write classes like UIComponent (8406 lines), Container (5055 lines), and DataGrid (4884 lines).  And you can also meet people who have never written an AS class longer than 100 lines - like me!  Get all the details and RSVP:

Also coming up February 7th I am presenting on [Sexy Web Apps with Java, Mozilla Tamarin, and Flex](http://www.baychi.org/bof/java/20070207/) in Mountain View.

I hope I will get to see many of you at these events.  If you don't live in the Bay Area then please talk to your local Java User Group (or other SIG) about having me come present on Flex.  Sorry we can't take "Meet the Flex Team" on the road.  :)
