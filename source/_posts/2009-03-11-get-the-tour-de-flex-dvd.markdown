If you or someone you love needs to experience Flex...
If you attend a user group with members that need to behold the beauty of Flex...
If you have friends / colleagues that have not yet experienced the joy of Flex...

... Then please email gwilson at adobe dot com with the subject of "Flex DVD" and with the following info:




	
  * Your mailing address

	
  * Number of DVDs you need

	
  * Reason you need so many

	
  * Reason you don't need more

	
  * Reason you still have a DVD player in your computer (come on people it's 2009!)



We hope that this will help every developer, every where, experience the love of Flex.
