UPDATE 1: Flash Builder 4, BlazeDS 4, and Spring 1.0.3 have all been release so you no longer have to use beta or nightly builds of these products.  Use the production versions!

UPDATE 2: A Refcard on [Integrating Spring 3 and Flex 4](http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/flex-4-and-spring-3), which I co-authored, is now available! It provides a step-by-step tutorial for setting up everything I show in the video below.

Last week I posted [a screencast](/2010/01/11/flash-builder-4-data-wizards-with-java-spring/) that walks through the basics of connecting a Flex 4 application to a Java / Spring back-end with the new Data Wizards in Flash Builder 4.  Here is a new video that extends beyond just simple RPC method calls and adds Hibernate for persistence.  Let me know what you think.
