One of [my old blogs](/wordpress/2007/07/24/tutorial-salesforcecom-on-air-with-flex-3/) has been turned into a full article on the Adobe Developer Connection and updated for Flex 3 Beta 2 & Adobe AIR Beta 2:
[Building an Adobe AIR application on salesforce.com with Flex 3](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/flex_air_salesforce.html)

Also a recording of the session that I hosted at Dreamforce has been posted on the Apex Developer Network:
[Make Your App *Bling*: Build Amazing Salesforce Apps Using Adobe Tech.](http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Dreamforce07_Dev_Sessions) (click on "Apex & Beyond" then scroll down to the session)

Lastly, in the next few weeks we will be releasing an update to the [Flex Toolkit for Apex](http://flex.org/salesforce) which adds simple local caching for AIR applications.  More information as soon as we finishing implementing the basic CRUD functions.
