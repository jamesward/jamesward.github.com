Client + Cloud technologies have been quickly evolving and maturing. The
combination of Flex and Salesforce.com continue to lead the way for next
generation Client + Cloud applications. Recently I did a [Webinar on The Flash
Platform and Salesforce.com](http://seminars.adobe.acrobat.com/p26603860/)
with Dave Carroll from Salesforce. If you missed it you can watch the
recording to see how you can begin developing Client + Cloud apps. Also [watch
Jeff Douglas demo an offline case management
app](http://blog.jeffdouglas.com/2010/02/01/adobe-air-applications-with-
salesforce/) he built with Flex and Force.com. Awesome stuff!

Last week I was able to spend a few hours with [Model
Metrics](http://www.modelmetrics.com) porting their [Pharma2GO Adobe AIR
app](http://www.modelmetrics.com/solutions/2go-mobile-cloud-platform/) to run
on an Android Mobile device. Using the [AIR for Android
Prerelease](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air2/android/) we quickly
created a mobile friendly UI with Flex and reused the same data sync code from
the desktop app. Check out the end result:

Listen to what Model Metrics had to say about this in their blog "[HTML 5 â€“
Ready for Primetime in the
Enterprise?](http://www.modelmetrics.com/general/html-5-%E2%80%93-ready-for-
primetime-in-the-enterprise/)":

> One of our early iPhone products on the iTunes AppStore was Search2GO, a
simple search tool for Salesforce.com. This was built in Objective C and it
took approximately 8 weeks to develop. Yesterday I watched two developers
create over half of this same functionality using Flex/AIR and had it running
on an Android phone in a day. Granted there are still things that could be
added, but this was a great illustration of why Flex/AIR is a great toolset.

  
These are exciting times for Client + Cloud apps now that the "Client" can
easily be on the web, desktop, and mobile device using the same technologies
and tools!
