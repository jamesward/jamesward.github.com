I recently [recorded a
podcast](http://java.dzone.com/podcasts/james_ward_flex_air_java) with James
Sugrue for DZone. In the podcast we talk about why Flex and Adobe AIR are
relevant to Java developers. You can either listen to [the
podcast](http://java.dzone.com/podcasts/james_ward_flex_air_java) or read
transcribed text. It's good to see DZone doing a lot more Flex related content
including the Refcardz I've co-authored: [Very First Steps in
Flex](http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/very-first-steps-flex) and [Flex and
Spring Integration](http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/flex-spring-
integration).

Let me know what you think of the podcast. Thanks!
