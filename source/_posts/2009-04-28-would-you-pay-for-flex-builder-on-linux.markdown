The current [alpha version](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flexbuilder_linux.html) of Flex Builder on Linux doesn't have feature parity with the Windows and Mac versions of Flex Builder.  It is scheduled to timeout on December 1, 2009 and current development [seems to be on hold](http://gruchalski.com/2009/04/22/flex-builder-3-for-linux-on-hold/).  If you would like to see Adobe create a full version of Flex Builder for Linux then please go vote for [feature request #FB-19053](http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FB-19053)!  Thanks!
