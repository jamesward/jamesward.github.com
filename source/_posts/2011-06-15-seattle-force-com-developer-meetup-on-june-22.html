Next week I'll be presenting in Seattle at my first <a href="http://www.developerforce.com/events/seattle_developer_meetup/registration.php?d=70130000000G4WO">Force.com Developer Meetup</a>!  It starts at 6pm on Wednesday, June 22.  My session will be on Flex Mobile Development. Other sessions include Force.com Platform Basics, Native iOS Development using JavaScript, and a Force.com Hands-On Lab.  It's going to be a fun evening, so if you are in the Seattle area, then I hope to see you there!
