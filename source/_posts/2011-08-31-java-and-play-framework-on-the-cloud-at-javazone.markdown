Next week I am speaking in Oslo at [JavaZone](http://jz11.java.no/) about
deploying Java and [Play! Framework](http://www.playframework.org) apps on the
Cloud. I submitted the session before [Heroku for
Java](http://www.jamesward.com/2011/08/25/heroku-adds-java-support) was
available so I had to obfuscate the title and description. If you are at
JavaZone then I hope to see you at my "[Deploying Apps on
Heroku](http://javazone.no/incogito10/events/JavaZone%202011/sessions#f4ae4b01
-1d5b-43fc-b635-af26388ddbf3)" session!
