At the Rich Web Experience 2009 conference, [Matt Raible](http://raibledesigns.com/) presented [a very insightful comparison of "kick-ass" web frameworks](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/comparing_kick_ass_web_frameworks) including Flex, Google Web Toolkit (GWT), Ruby on Rails and Grails.  I appreciate his "right tool for the job" approach which moves beyond technology dogma towards real solutions.  He includes some very revealing charts comparing jobs posts, [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) posts, mailing list traffic and other stats.  Check out the slides from his presentation:
