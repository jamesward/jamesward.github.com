Yesterday was an exciting day!  Bruce Eckel and I hosted an eSeminar about Flex & Java.  We had a few technical difficulties, but overall it was very good.  You can watch the recording here:

Also yesterday the Open Source [Buni Meldware Communication Suite](http://www.buni.org/mediawiki/index.php/Meldware_Communications_Suite) joined the [Java.net](https://meldware.dev.java.net/) community.  This is a great step forward for the project, which uses Flex for it's Webmail client.  More info from Andy Oliver:

And lastly, while at the Adobe Engage conference, I gained a Twitter addiction.  Please help me indulge my addiction and add me as a friend:
