I had the great pleasure of being invited to be a guest speaker on the [second RIA Weekly podcast](http://redmonk.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=285181) with [Cot√© from RedMonk](http://www.redmonk.com/cote/) and [Ryan Stewart](http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/).  In the podcast we discuss Oracle's recent move to Flex and RIA as well as Java and Flex.  Let me know what you think.
