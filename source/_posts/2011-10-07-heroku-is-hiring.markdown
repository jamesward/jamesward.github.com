It's been four months since I started working at Heroku as a Developer
Evangelist. Now it is clear to me that I got really lucky. Heroku is a top-
notch place to work. The product is sexy. The people are all rock stars.
Heroku is owned by Salesforce.com so there is the stability of a large company
but the start-up culture remains in place.

Heroku is looking to hire [lots of people (engineers, marketing,
etc)](http://jobs.heroku.com/) but of particular interest to my readers might
be the [Java Developer Evangelist](http://heroku.theresumator.com/apply/F1VGjh
/Java-Developer-Evangelist.html) position. Come work with me to help educate
Java developers about Heroku!

BTW: Check out how the application asks for your GitHub URL. I love this
place!
