I've gone commercial. Kinda. I just bought jamesward.com and it is now my
primary domain name instead of jamesward.org. I liked the .org URL but it's a
less familiar URL to non-geeks. You say .com and everyone knows what you mean.
The .org will still work - redirects right to here.

So I'm a sell-out. Gone .com. Good news is that you still won't see any ads on
my site.

Let me know if you have any problems with the new domain.
