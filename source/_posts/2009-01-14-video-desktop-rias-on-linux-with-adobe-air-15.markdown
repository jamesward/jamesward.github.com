Adobe recently [announced](http://blogs.adobe.com/air/2008/12/adobe_air_15_now_available_for.html) the release of Adobe AIR 1.5 for Linux!  For us Linux users this is huge!  Now desktop RIAs with Adobe AIR work the same on Windows, Mac, and Linux!  I recorded a short instructional video that shows how to get it working.

  
(Original video size is 1024 x 768 so you might want to [open it in a new window or tab](/air_on_linux).)
