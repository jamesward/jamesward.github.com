Yesterday Mozilla released [Firefox 0.9
rc1](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.9rc) and I just
couldn't wait any longer for the ebuild, so I figured out how to get it built
from the cvs source. The instructions are posted on the [Gentoo
Forums](http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=183733). Not a big deal, but
I thought this was blog worthy since it was fun and exciting. I guess that
makes me a nerd. :)
