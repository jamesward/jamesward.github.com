Tomorrow at 3:30 at Adobe MAX 2008 there will be a session on building rich
Internet applications in the cloud using Salesforce and Adobe Flex. They will
even be [giving away](http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2008/11/visit-us-at-
ado.html) a new Macbook! The combination of Flex and Force.com (the platform
side of Salesforce) is a fantastic way to build RIAs in the cloud. If you are
at MAX this is a session not to miss!
