I'll be speaking at two great events next week on the East Coast.  First up is [HTML5 Live](http://html5live.org/html5-nyc-2010/) in New York on Tuesday November 9th.  At HTML5 Live I'll be talking about "[Development Tools for Building HTML5 Content & Applications](http://html5live.org/html5-nyc-2010/presentation/Development+Tools+for+Building+HTML5+Content+%26+Applications)".  Then on Friday November 12th I'll be at [RIA Unleashed](http://riaunleashed.com/) in Boston talking about "[Flex 4.5 Hero](http://riaunleashed.com/page.cfm/agenda)".  These two events will certainly be enlightening.  :)  I hope to see you there!
