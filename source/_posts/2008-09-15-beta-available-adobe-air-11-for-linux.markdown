Having used Linux as my primary desktop for over ten years I can't help but be
a bit jealous of all the great software Windows and Mac users have available
to them. But I can't really blame the software creators for focusing on only
those platforms. It's just purely economics. The cost / benefit of making
software work on Linux just isn't there for most consumer software. What we
have always dreamed of is "Write Once, Run Anywhere". Why can't software
developers write applications for one OS and have it run on all of them?

Adobe Systems has been making great progress turning the dream of consistent,
ubiquitous, and cross-platform software run times into reality. This is one of
the many reasons I am excited about what Adobe is doing with their software
platform technologies and I am happy to be a Technical Evangelist for them.
The Flash Player releases have been sim-shipping on all three major platforms
(Windows, Mac, and Linux) for almost a year now. But the recent addition to
the platform stack, Adobe AIR, is still lagging a bit behind on Linux. Today
Adobe [posted a beta build of Adobe AIR 1.1 for
Linux](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/) on the labs.adobe.com site. We
all hope that soon even the AIR releases will sim-ship on all three major
operating systems. But until then, go download this beta, give it a try and
[let Adobe know](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/categories.cfm?f
orumid=72&catid=677&entercat=y) how it works for you.
