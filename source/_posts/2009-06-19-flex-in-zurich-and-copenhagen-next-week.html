With the recent beta releases of <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashbuilder4/">Flash Builder 4</a> and <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashcatalyst/">Flash Catalyst</a> there is a lot of fun stuff going on.  Next week I'll be speaking in Zurich at Jazoon on Tuesday about <a href="http://jazoon.com/en/conference/presentationdetails.html?type=sid&detail=6662">RIAs with Java, Spring, Hibernate, BlazeDS, and Flex</a>.  On Wednesday I'll be speaking in Copenhagen about <a href="http://groups.adobe.com/posts/30ecd71201">Flex 4 and Flash Catalyst</a>.  Thursday I'm back in Zurich speaking about <a href="http://groups.adobe.com/posts/8567335b9f">Flex 4</a>.  And finally on Friday I'll be speaking at <a href="http://fatl.ch/?page_id=136&lang=en-us">Flash at the Lake</a> about Pixel Bender and <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/blog/2009/04/29/announcing-pbjas-an-actionscript-3-pixel-bender-shader-library/">pbjAS</a>.  Lots of fun stuff!  I hope to see some of you along the way.
