Adobe has released [Adobe Reader 9.1 for Linux](http://get.adobe.com/reader/)!
This is the first 9.x release on Linux and has a number of new features. My
personal favorite is the inclusion of Flash Player so that [Portable
RIAs](http://www.jamesward.com/blog/portable-rias-tutorial/) will work on
Linux! Portable RIAs are beginning to catch on more and so it's great to have
true cross-platform support for them.
