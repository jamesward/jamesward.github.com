It's hard to believe that [Adobe MAX 2008](http://max.adobe.com/) in the US is only 4 months away!  It's going to be another great MAX and I really hope that you can make it.  This year I have one session:
[![](http://www.adobe.com/1to1_campaigns/2008_MAX/banners/MAX08_B125x125.jpg)](http://www.adobe.com/go/maxexplorer)

**Working with Data in Flex**
Explore various methods for accessing data in applications built with Flex 3. We’ll discuss how to connect with back ends such as ColdFusion, PHP, .NET, and Java using REST and XML, Web Services, Remoting, Messaging, and the LiveCycle Data Management Service. We’ll also discuss underlying formats such as XML and how to manipulate it using E4X, AMF3, and JSON.

The session list is now [online](http://max.adobe.com/na/sessions/browser/).  So check it out and [go register](http://max.adobe.com/na/register/) today!
