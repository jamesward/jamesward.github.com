[InfoQ.com](http://infoq.com) has posted an [old interview](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/05/interview-ward-flex-air) I did with [Jon Rose](http://ectropic.com) at their QCon SF 2007 conference.  In this slightly dated interview I talk about the usual Flex, Adobe AIR, and RIA topics.  Makes me wish I still had my beard.  Gosh I was sexy.  ;)
