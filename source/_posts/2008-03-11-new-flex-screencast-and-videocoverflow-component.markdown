For the Flex 2 product pages on adobe.com I recorded a screencast of [a Flex app being built in 11 minutes](http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2006/11/14/screencast-watch-a-flex-app-built-in-11-minutes/).  For Flex 3 I recorded [a new version of that screencast](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/media/flexapp/).  In the new version I used [Doug McCune's CoverFlow component](http://dougmccune.com/blog/2007/11/19/flex-coverflow-performance-improvement-flex-carousel-component-and-vertical-coverflow/) but extended it to easily support playing videos.  Check out [a demo of the VideoCoverFlow component](http://www.jamesward.org/myTube/myTube.html) and right-click to download the [source code](/myTube/srcview/index.html).  For those trying to use the VideoCoverFlow component - the implementation has changed slightly since I recorded the screencast so check out the myTube application for an example of how to use it.

Thanks Doug for the CoverFlow component.
