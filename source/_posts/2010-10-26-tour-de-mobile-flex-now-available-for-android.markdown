![](http://flex.org/images/tdfss150.png)[Tour de Flex](http://flex.org/tour)
was launched at Adobe MAX two years ago. In that time Tour de Flex has become
an essential resource for learning Flex. Now that you can build Flex apps for
mobile devices with the [Flex Hero
prerelease](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flexsdk_hero/) we thought we
should build a version of Tour de Flex for mobile devices. Using Flex Hero and
[AIR for Android](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/) we've created [Tour de
Mobile Flex](http://flex.org/tourmobile)! This is a great way to explore the
capabilities of Adobe AIR and Flex on mobile devices. Get it from the Android
Market by searching for "Tour de Mobile Flex"!

Download the [Tour de Mobile Flex Flash Builder Project
(FXP)](http://flex.org/TourDeMobileFlex.fxp) or [get the code from
github](http://github.com/jamesward/TourDeMobileFlex). And let me know what
you think!

UPDATE: To compile the latest code on github you will need the latest private
prerelease of Flash Builder. You can get more information about the private
prerelease on the [Flex Team Blog](http://blogs.adobe.com/flex/2011/02/flex-
sdk-and-flash-builder-pre-release-program.html).
