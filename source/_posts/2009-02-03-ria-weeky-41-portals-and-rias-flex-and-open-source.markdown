Last week I was able to be a guest speaker on the [RIA
Weekly](http://www.riaweekly.com) podcast. In [the
episode](http://www.riaweekly.com/2009/01/30/riaweekly041)
[Cot√©](http://www.redmonk.com/cote/) and I talked about RIAs in Portals, Flex
and Open Source, and other various topics. Give it a listen and let us know
what you think.
