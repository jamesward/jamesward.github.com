I'll be at the [TriJUG](http://trijug.org/meetinginfo.jsp?date=2009-03) tonight talking about integrating Flex and Java in real-world applications.

On Wednesday March 18th I'll be speaking at [TheServerSide Java Symposium](http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/html/frameworks.html#JWardFlex) in Vegas.

And on March 24th I'll be speaking in Miami at the [Miami JUG](http://miamijug.wordpress.com/2009/03/06/march-meeting/).

Hope to see some of you along the way!
