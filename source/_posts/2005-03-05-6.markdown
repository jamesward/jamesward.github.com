The second version of the TreeGrid component is done. It is working much
better thanks to comments from Matt and Jose. I was able to resolve all of the
issues I was aware of except the hard coded reference to "product". I was even
able to get recursion working. I think I may have to eventually extend
DataGrid so that I can add column sorting. Here are the changes I would still
like to make to it: - Column sorting is currently disabled. I would like to
make it work... Maybe it would just sort top level nodes. What do you all
think? - Column resizing does not clip the disclosure icon correctly. The
Label gets clipped right, but not the icon. Any ideas? - Any other ideas to
make this better?

Well here it is:

[Here is the mxml code](http://www.cayambe.com/TreeGrid-v2/TreeGrid.mxml.txt)
[Here is the cellRenderer
code](http://www.cayambe.com/TreeGrid-v2/TreeGridCellRenderer.as)

Please let me know your comments and suggestions.
