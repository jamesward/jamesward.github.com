The second version of the TreeGrid component is done.  It is working much better thanks to comments from Matt and Jose.  I was able to resolve all of the issues I was aware of except the hard coded reference to "product".  I was even able to get recursion working.  I think I may have to eventually extend DataGrid so that I can add column sorting.  Here are the changes I would still like to make to it:

* Column sorting is currently disabled.  I would like to make it work...  Maybe it would just sort top level nodes.  What do you all think?
* Column resizing does not clip the disclosure icon correctly.  The Label gets clipped right, but not the icon.  Any ideas?

Any other ideas to make this better?

Well here it is:

[Here is the mxml code](/demos/TreeGrid-v2/TreeGrid.mxml.txt)  
[Here is the cellRenderer code](/demos/TreeGrid-v2/TreeGridCellRenderer.as)

Please let me know your comments and suggestions.
