Just a quick note to let everyone know that I'll be at Salesforce.com's
Dreamforce conference next week in San Francisco. On Tuesday I'll be [co-
presenting a
session](http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF08/tracks/learn.jsp?s=2#) on
using Adobe AIR and Flex with Force.com. The rest of the time I'll probably be
in the developer lounge hacking on Flex code. Stop by and say hello!
