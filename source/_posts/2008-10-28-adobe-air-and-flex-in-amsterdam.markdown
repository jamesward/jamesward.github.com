In a few weeks I'll be over in Amsterdam for
[JFall](http://www.nljug.org/jfall/) and [FlexCamp](http://www.flexcamp.nl/).
Both events will have some new and exciting presentations about Adobe AIR and
Flex. At JFall I'll be presenting "[The Future of the Open Source Flex
SDK](http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2008/sessions/00036/)"
and at the FlexCamp I'll be presenting "[Gumbo, what will bring Flex4 to
us](http://www.nljug.org/jfall/)". I hope to see you there!
