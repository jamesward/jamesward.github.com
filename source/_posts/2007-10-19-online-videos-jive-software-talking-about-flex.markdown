Jive Software has always stood out to me as being a company that really cares
about the user experience. I remember way back nearly 10 years ago when Jive
Forums was one of the only (or at least most popular) commercial products
built on the Java stack. Recently I was able to meet some of the Jive folks
when I presented at the Portland Java User Group. You can tell that they are
passionate about creating great software. So it's great to see that Jive
Software is embracing Flex!

To see some of the Jive folks talking about Flex check out these videos:

Jive, keep up the great work! I can't wait to see how you build amazing user
experiences with Flex and Adobe AIR!
