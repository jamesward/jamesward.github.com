[Artima](http://artima.com) recently posted two interviews with me which relate to Flex.  First is an interview about [Adobe's Open Screen Project](http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=270&thread=230045).  The second is called [Rich-Client Misconceptions](http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/javaone_2008_james_ward.html).  Also Bruce Eckel recently posted a very interesting article on Artima called "[Concurrency with Python, Twisted, and Flex](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=230001)".  Let me know what you think about those.
