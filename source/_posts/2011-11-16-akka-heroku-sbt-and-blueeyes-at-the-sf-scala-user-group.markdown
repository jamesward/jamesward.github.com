Next Monday at the [San Francisco Scala User Group](http://www.meetup.com/SF-
Scala/) I will be co-presenting about [Akka, Heroku, sbt and
BlueEyes](http://www.meetup.com/SF-Scala/events/39108572/) with [Mike
Slinn](http://micronauticsresearch.com/) - a long time friend and mentor. In
the presentation we will be talking about a building client/server apps with
HTML5 on the client and Scala & JSON services on the server. We will also show
how to deploy these applications on the cloud with Heroku. Hope to see you
there!
