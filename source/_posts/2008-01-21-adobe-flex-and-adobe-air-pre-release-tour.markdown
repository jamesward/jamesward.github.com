Today I leave for Europe where I will kick off my first few stops on the [Adobe Flex and Adobe AIR Pre-Release Tour](http://flex.org/tour) - Paris, Milan, London, Amsterdam, and Brussels.  Then next week I take a week off the tour to speak at the [Tampa Java User Group](http://tampajug.org/).  The following week I resume the tour in the Midwest - Minneapolis, Chicago, Kansas City, and St Louis.  Find out more details about the tour at: [flex.org/tour](http://www.flex.org/tour)

I'm looking forward to meeting more of the Flex community over the next few weeks and hopefully you! (If you happen to live near any of those locations.)
