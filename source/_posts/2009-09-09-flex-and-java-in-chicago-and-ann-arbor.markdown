This month I'll be presenting about Flex and Java at the Chicago and Ann Arbor
Java User Groups:

  * [Chicago - September 15](http://www.cjug.org/Wiki.jsp?page=2009.09.15.downtown)
  * [Ann Arbor - September 22](http://aajug.org/?p=139)
  
Also on September 22 I'll be doing a [Flex Jam in Ann
Arbor](http://aajug.org/?p=139) (all day coding and exploration).

I hope to see some of you at one of these events!
