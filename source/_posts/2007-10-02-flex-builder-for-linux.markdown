I love [vi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi). I've been doing Flex development
on Linux for about three years - mostly with vi. But to be honest when
building complex applications it is nice to have things like code hinting and
integrated debugging. I'm sure you *could* make vi do that with Flex but I am
not brave enough to attempt to figure that out. So I'm extremely excited that
Adobe is releasing a version of Flex Builder for Linux! You can download Flex
Builder for Linux from the
[labs.adobe.com](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/flexbuilder_linux/)
site right now!

Having Flex Builder for Linux really empowers us Linux geeks to easily build
Rich Internet Applications. Flex 2 & Flex 3 applications can run in the
browser via Flash Player 9 which has been available for Linux for more than a
year. To run Flex applications as Desktop applications we need the Adobe
Integrated Runtime, AIR. Adobe AIR isn't yet available for Linux. But I've
been having pretty good success testing / debugging Flex based AIR
applications on Linux over the past few weeks since I discovered that [you can
use Wine and adl.exe to run AIR applications on Linux](/wordpress/2007/09/13
/testing-air-applications-on-linux/).

This is great news for developers - especially developers that use Linux! But
do I miss vi? I really do. I really wish there were vi key bindings in Eclipse
(and there probably is but I haven't found a project that does that yet). Go
give the new Flex Builder for Linux a try and let us know how it goes! Please
file bugs and feature requests on [the public Flex bug
database](http://bugs.adobe.com/flex).
