There have been a lot of exciting things happening with Flex and Salesforce / Force.com lately.  First Ryan Marples recently [announced](http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2009/05/an-update-to-the-forcecom-toolkit-for-adobe-flex-and-air.html) the release of an updated version of the [Force.com Toolkit for Adobe AIR and Flex](http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Flex_Toolkit).  If you are doing development with Flex and Salesforce or Force.com you should download this new release to take advantage of the latest enhancements to the web services APIs.

Today Adobe updated the Adobe Developer Connection's page containing information about [integrating Flex and Salesforce / Force.com](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/salesforce/).  This new page contains new videos, demos, articles, and other great content.  Check it out and let us know what you think.

We are looking for people interested in authoring articles (either technical or decision maker focused) about integrating Flex and Salesforce / Force.com.  Please email me if you are interested: jaward at adobe dot com
