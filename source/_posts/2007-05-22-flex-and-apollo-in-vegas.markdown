This week I'm in Vegas for a few presentations. First one is at the [Interop
conference](http://interop.com/lasvegas/education/webops.php) on Wednesday.
Interop is a fun place for me because I get to hang out with networking / sys
admin folks. In a past life I was a sys admin (thus the reason why I love vi).
:)

On Thursday night I am presenting at the [Vegas Adobe User
Group](http://gman.mxdj.com/flex_vegas_with_james_ward.htm) and really looking
forward to meeting some of the Flex friends I've only known via email, blogs,
twitter, etc.

I was also supposed to present at the local JUG but the meeting was canceled
because there was a conflicting conference that everyone was going to be at.
Oh-well. Time to go lose money instead!
