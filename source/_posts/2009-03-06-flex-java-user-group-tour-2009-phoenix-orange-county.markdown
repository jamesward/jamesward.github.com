Next week I begin a Java User Group tour where I'll be talking about
integrating Flex with Java, Spring, and Hibernate. First stop is the [Phoenix
JUG](http://www.phxjug.org/meetings.html#next) on Wednesday March 11. Then
I'll be at the [Orange County
JUG](http://www.ocjug.org/presos/abstract.jsp?id=81) on Thursday March 12.

I'll be at a number of other JUGs over the next few months. I hope to see you
along the way!
