While I was at Dreamforce this year I had the chance to do a video interview with Peter Coffee from Salesforce.com.  In this interview we discussed the industry momentum behind RIAs in enterprise software and how Flex, Adobe AIR, and Force.com are being combined to deliver much better user experiences in business applications.  The recorded interview is below.  You can also find the original post on <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2007/11/as-ive-previous.html">Peter Coffee's blog</a>.
