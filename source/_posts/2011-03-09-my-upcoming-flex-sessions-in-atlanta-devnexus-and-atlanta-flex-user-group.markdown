In a few weeks I'll be speaking in Atlanta at [DevNexus](http://www.devnexus.com/) and at the [Atlanta Flex User Group](http://www.meetup.com/atlflex).  On March 21, 2011 at DevNexus I have two sessions:




  * [AS34J - ActionScript for Java Developers](http://www.devnexus.com/s/presentations#1156)


  * [Rapid Mobile & Tablet App Development with Spring and Flex](http://www.devnexus.com/s/presentations#1155)


On March 22, 2011 at the Atlanta Flex User Group I will be presenting about [Flex 4.5 - The Non-Mobile New Features](http://www.meetup.com/atlflex/events/16734337/).

I hope to see you at DevNexus and at the Atlanta Flex User Group!
