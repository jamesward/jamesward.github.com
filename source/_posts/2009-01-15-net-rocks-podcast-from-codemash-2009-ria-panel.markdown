At [CodeMash 2009](http://www.codemash.org) I was able to participate in a
panel discussion about Rich Internet Applications, Flex, Silverlight, and
Ajax. The panel was moderated by Richard and Carl from the [.NET Rocks!
podcast](http://www.dotnetrocks.com). Also on the panel was [Josh
Holmes](http://joshholmes.com/) and [Jesse
Liberty](http://silverlight.net/blogs/jesseliberty/) from Microsoft and [Leon
Gersing](http://www.fallenrogue.com/). It was a fun panel - especially since
we enjoyed some fine whiskey during it! But also because it's great to see how
we all have common goals - we all want software to be better no matter what
the underlying technology is.

In case you weren't at CodeMash you can [listen to the recording from .Net
Rocks!](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=412) and then let me
know what you think.
