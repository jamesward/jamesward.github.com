Last week while many of us were gallivanting around Vegas at MAX, Oracle was
holding their OpenWorld conference in San Francicso. Unfortunately I wasn't
able to be in two places at once, so I didn't attend OpenWorld. But I did have
the opportunity of building a Flex demo for one of the Oracle keynotes. I
really just took a few of our sample applications and portalized them. You can
see the end result on [Oracle's Portlet Testing Site](http://portalstandards.o
racle.com/portal/page/portal/FlexPG/Flex%20Demo%201/Tab). One cool thing to
point out is that the portlets are actually remote portlets being served via
Oracle's JPDK. In case you want to play around with these portlets in your own
portal, the provider url is: [http://www.jamesward.org:8888/flexportlets/provi
ders/flex_portlets](http://www.jamesward.org:8888/flexportlets/providers/flex_
portlets)

Also be sure to read the Oracle Press Release: [Oracle and Adobe Collaborate
to Enable Enterprise Rich Client Development](http://www.oracle.com/corporate/
press/2006_oct/openworldsf06-06.html)

And an article I helped write: [Providing Rich Portlets with Adobe
Flex](http://www.adobe.com/go/flexportalintegration)

In the past 2 months Flex was used in a keynote at Intel's developer
conference, a Flex application took second place at SAP TechED's Demo Jam, and
most recently Oracle did the keynote Flex demo at OpenWorld! Enterprise
software continues to be transformed by Flex!
