In case you missed the Flex 3 / Adobe AIR 1.0 Pre-release Tour that went on
around the world in January you can [watch a
recording](http://www.adobeusergroup.nl/2008/01/25/25-januari-2008-verslag-
special-pre-release-flex-air-en-blazeds) of the session [Serge
Jespers](http://www.webkitchen.be/) and I did in Amsterdam. It starts out in
Dutch but soon switches to English. You can skip ahead by clicking on a topic
on the bottom left, then clicking the "Bekijk deze sessie". Let me know what
you think.
