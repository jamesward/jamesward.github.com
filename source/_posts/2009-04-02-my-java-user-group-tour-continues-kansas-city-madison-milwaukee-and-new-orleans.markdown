On the road again...  I'll be talking about Flex and Java at a few more Java User Groups over the next few weeks.  Here they are:





  * [Kansas City JUG](http://www.kcjava.org/kcjava.htm) - April 8th


  * [Madison, WI JUG](http://www.capjug.org/capjug/) - April 14th


  * [Milwaukee](http://www.wjug.org/wjug/nextmeeting.jsp) - April 15th


  * [New Orleans](http://cajunjug.blogspot.com/) - April 16th



Hope to see you somewhere along the way!
