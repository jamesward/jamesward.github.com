Over the past few years I've attended a bunch of geek/coder events in the Colorado Mountains.  It always surprises me how much I can learn by getting away, being around some really smart people, and writing code with them.  So I'm incredibly excited to be attending [The Programming Summer Camp 2011](https://sites.google.com/site/programmingsummercamp/) this summer in Crested Butte, Colorado!

At the summer camp you can choose which campsite to hangout in.  Or if you want, you can create your own campsite!  I'll probably spend most of my time in the Scala campsite.  But I look forward to mingling in some of the other campsites as well.

It's like I'm a kid again - getting all excited about going to camp!  But I really hope you all can join me July 25 - 29 in Crested Butte, Colorado for [The Programming Summer Camp 2011](https://sites.google.com/site/programmingsummercamp/)!
