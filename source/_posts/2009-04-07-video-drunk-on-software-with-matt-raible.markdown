[Matt Raible](http://raibledesigns.com/) is a legend in the world of Java web applications.  In the [latest episode](http://www.drunkonsoftware.com/2009/04/05/episode-11-matt-raible/) of [Drunk on Software](http://www.drunkonsoftware.com) [Jon Rose](http://www.ectropic.com) and I sit down with Matt, have a few beers, and talk geek stuff.  Matt has a lot of great insight into where software is going.  In the video we asked him what the future looks like for web frameworks.  Matt's response brought into question the future of component frameworks.  Jon and I were pretty surprised by his response.  You will have to watch the video to get the whole story.  :)  Let us know what you think.
