Integrating Flex into portals has always been an interesting topic for enterprise developers.  Other than [a blog](http://www.jamesward.com/2006/11/02/flex-your-oracle-portal/) I did a while back there hasn't been much information out there about how to get Flex apps into portals.  But I just read a great article on IBM developerWorks about [Integrating Adobe Flex with IBM WebSphere Portal](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0911_el-hadik/0911_el-hadik.html?S_TACT=105AGX10&S_CMP=LP).  It's a great read for enterprise developers looking to combine Flex and WebSphere Portal.
