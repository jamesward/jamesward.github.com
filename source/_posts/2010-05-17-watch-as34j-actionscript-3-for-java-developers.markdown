Last week I did an eSeminar on [AS34J - ActionScript 3 for Java Developers](http://seminars.adobe.acrobat.com/p69179960/).  This was originally a presentation that [Chet Haase](http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/) and I did at [Devoxx](http://www.devoxx.com).  Later Chet also published the presentation as a two part article on JavaWorld ([Part 1](http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2009/jw-02-actionscript1.html) and [Part 2](http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-2009/jw-03-actionscript2.html)).  Check out the [eSeminar](http://seminars.adobe.acrobat.com/p69179960/) and let me know what you think.
