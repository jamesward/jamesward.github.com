Intuit has been using Flex in some very exciting ways recently.  One of those is to use Flex as a developer SDK for QuickBase.  This allows developers to easily build a great user interface on top of the solid and in-the-cloud back-end of QuickBase.  You can find out more about this in the [QuickBase Developer Program](http://developer.intuit.com/technical_resources/QuickBase/).

A few weeks ago I presented to developers in the QuickBase Developer Program about making Flex applications look and feel great by adding effects and by skinning components.  Intuit has allowed me to repost that presentation here.  Let me know what you think.
