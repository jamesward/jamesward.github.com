Today Adobe launched <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex 3</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Adobe AIR 1.0</a> – the most mature and comprehensive platform for Rich Internet Applications in existence.

The news of the launch is everywhere but I wanted to point out a few of the most exciting things related to this launch.

The Flex SDK and BlazeDS are now <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com">officially open source</a>.

InfoQ has published an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/flex3-update">interview with me</a> on the Flex 3 launch.  They have also posted an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/air-1.0-overview">interview with Kevin Hoyt</a> on the AIR 1.0 launch as well as <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/air-flex-release">an overview of today's announcements</a>.

Salesforce.com and Adobe have launched the <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2008/02/25/announcing-the-forcecom-toolkit-for-adobe-air-and-flex/">Force.com Toolkit for Adobe AIR and Flex</a>.

Not really related to the launch but also very exciting – Chet Haase, Java Swing guru and co-author of Filthy Rich Clients has <a href="http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-hello-world.html">joined the Flex engineering team</a>.

This launch is the biggest RIA launch ever!  I can't wait to see what you build with these awesome technologies!
