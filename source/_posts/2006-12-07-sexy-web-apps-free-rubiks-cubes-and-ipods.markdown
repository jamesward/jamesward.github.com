What more could a nerd want? Next week I will be at
[JavaPolis](http://www.javapolis.com) talking about [Building Sexy Web Apps](h
ttp://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP06/Building+Sexy+Web+apps+with+Fl
ex). Attendees will receive a free Flex Edition Rubik's Cube! The first person
to solve theirs will win an iPod nano! Then on Thursday at 4:10pm, bring your
Flex Edition cubes to the Adobe booth for speedcubing madness! Fastest
speedcuber gets an iPod nano! If I still have any cubes left on Friday, you
will also be able to get them at either of my sessions; [Adobe Flex 2.0 & Java
: RIA for the Enterprise](http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.a
ction?pageId=27174) or [Flex 2.0 @ Work in combination with Spring and Hiberna
te](http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP06/Flex+2.0+at+work+in+combi
nation+with+Spring+and+Hibernate). Better start practicing your speedcubing!
These Flex Edition cubes are much harder than regular Rubik's cubes! See you
in Antwerp!

*** Update *** I didn't realize it before but I guess we are expecting a ton of people and I'm only going to drag 150 Rubik's Cubes to Antwerp. So, the first 150 lucky people at the session on Tuesday will get the free Flex Edition cubes. So get there early!
