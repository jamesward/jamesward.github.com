A little bug in the [Flex Bug DB](http://bugs.adobe.com/flex) made it so you could only vote for open bugs - which is kinda silly since deferred bugs are marked as "closed".  Well that bug has been fixed and now it's time for the Flex Bug Voting Exchange to commence!  Here's how it works - for each bug you vote for of mine (ones I own or just like) - I'll vote for one of yours!  Bugs in bold are worth 2 votes.  Just post your bugs you want me to vote for in the comments here.  But make sure you vote for mine!  Ok, so go and vote for these:




  * [**Support for mapping Java 5 Enums to strongly-typed AS3 classes**](https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/BLZ-17)


  * [set checkPolicyFile on NetStream through VideoDisplay](https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-12342)
