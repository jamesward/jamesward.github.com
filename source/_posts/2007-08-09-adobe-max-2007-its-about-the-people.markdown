For those who don't know, MAX is Adobe's yearly developer conference for products including Flex and AIR.  There will be tons of great presentations by many of our engineers.  Beyond the presentations what I enjoy most is the social aspect.  It's the conversations that happen between the customers, evangelists, engineers, pm's, execs, etc that make MAX great.  I hope that you will be able to join the conversation that will happen at [Adobe MAX 2007](http://www.adobemax2007.com/na/).  If you are planning on going, sign up by tomorrow so that you can take advantage of the early bird discount.
