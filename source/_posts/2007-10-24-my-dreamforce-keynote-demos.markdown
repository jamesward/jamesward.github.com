At Salesforce.com's 2007 developer conference, called Dreamforce, I did a few minutes of demos during the day two keynote with Marc Benioff and Bruce Chizen.  I showed three real applications built with Flex, Adobe AIR, and Salesforce.com.  It was a fun experience and I only had a few minor demo glitches.  Thanks to [PodTech](http://www.podtech.net/home/4418/adobe-flex-and-air-with-bruce-chizen-a-dreamforce07-keynote) the video is below.  My demos are about four minutes in.
