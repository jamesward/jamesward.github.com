Bruce Eckel has posted a terrific article on "[Creating Flex
Components](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=212818)". As
usual Bruce is able to promote understanding of deep technical topics through
simple examples and clear narrative.

Article Summary: _As Joe Nuxoll of JBuilder and JavaPosse fame will tell you
(given the slightest provocation), one place where the Java designers
completely dropped the ball is in Java's component model. This becomes
especially clear when comparing it with a system like Flex which has full
language support for components._
