Next week I'll be presenting at two great Flex events here in Denver,
Colorado. On Sunday April 10th, [Greg Wilson](http://gregsramblings.com/) and
I will be presenting an "Intro to Building Mobile Apps" at
[360|Flex](http://www.360flex.com/). Then on Tuesday April 12 [Mike
Labriola](http://www.digitalprimates.net/author/codeslinger/) and I will leave
the world of Flex bewildered and befuddled when we present "Planet of the
AOPs" (also at 360|Flex). And on Thursday April 14 I'll be presenting
"Building Cross-Device Apps with Flex" at the [Denver Flex
Camp](http://ria5280.org/calendar/event/2011/4/14/251740). It's going to be a
really fun week and I hope to see you there!
