For a while I have been wanting to create a TreeGrid component for Flex.  The basic idea is to allow a user to navigate a Tree like object within a DataGrid.  Well, I just finished a very hacky version 1:

<iframe src="/demos/TreeGrid/TreeGrid.mxml.swf" width="400" height="300"></iframe>

Here are some problems with the current implementation:

* I get strange flicker when mousing over the cells.  Don't know why.

* If I resize the right column to cover part of the Title, the title doesn't get clipped.  Don't know why.

* The code looks only for children named "product".  I don't know of a way to make this generic / configurable.

* Only supports 3 levels because I can't figure out how to do recursion in the disclosurePress function.  When I tried to call another function to do recursion the recursive method never got called.  Don't know why.


Other than all that, it works decently.  :)  Any ActionScript experts out there, please help me out.  :)

[Here is the mxml code](/demos/TreeGrid/TreeGrid.mxml)  
[Here is the cellRenderer code](/demos/TreeGrid/TreeGridCellRenderer.as)

Enjoy!
