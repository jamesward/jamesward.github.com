Flex and JSF have both been widely adopted by the Java Community. In many instances developers must choose between the two technologies. Today Exadel announced a new product called Fiji which alleviates this decision by providing a simple and seamless way to integrate Flex and JSF.

This is very exciting news for Java developers.  For more information read the [press release](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/09/prweb1261664.htm), check out the [product page](http://exadel.com/web/portal/fiji), or see the [live demos](http://livedemo.exadel.com/fiji-demo/).
