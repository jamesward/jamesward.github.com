Back in August at the [Flex Jam in
Orlando](http://www.codetown.us/profiles/blogs/flex-jam-in-orlando-with-james)
one of the projects we worked on was Text to Speech in Flex. We didn't finish
the project at the Jam so I wanted to post the final version here. Check it
out:  ([source
code](http://www.jamesward.com/demos/iSpeechDemo/srcview/index.html))

I used the [iSpeech.org API](http://www.ispeech.org/api) to convert the text
to speech. It was pretty easy to build this demo but a production version
would need to use a proxy so that the username and password can't be
discovered.

Let me know what you think.

UPDATE: Periodically this demo might stop working because I've run out of
credits at ispeech.org. If it doesn't work for you please post a comment here
and let me know.
