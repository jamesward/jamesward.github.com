Over the next few weeks I'll be presenting at a few conferences:

[GeoWeb - Map Based RIA Development Using Adobe Flex and AIR](http://geowebconference.org/program/workshops/workshops-tuesday) with [Duane Nickull](http://technoracle.blogspot.com/)

[OSCON - Flex: the Open Source SDK for RIAs](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/2218) also with Duane

[LinuxWorld - Building Rich Internet Applications with an Open Source Stack](http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/conference//tracks/tracksessions//QMONYB00BILW)

I hope to see some of you at those conferences.
