[Jon Rose](http://ectropic.com) and I have created a new [DZone
Refcard](http://refcardz.dzone.com/) called [Flex 4 and Spring 3
Integration](http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/flex-4-and-spring-3). In the
Refcard, we walk you through the steps for building RIAs with Flash Builder 4,
Flex 4, BlazeDS 4, Spring 3, the Spring BlazeDS Integration, and Hibernate.
Whew! That's a lot of pieces! The Refcard covers simple Remoting, Flex &
Hibernate integration through Spring (all Java annotation driven and using the
new data-centric development features in Flash Builder 4), Pub / Sub
Messaging, and Flex and Spring Security. We pack a lot into six pages!

If you want to see recorded presentations / screencasts of some of these
things check out:

I hope all of this is helpful. Let me know what you think.
