For the next wave of the Heroku Java User Group Tour I will be speaking about running Java, Play Framework, and Scala apps on the cloud in these three wonderful places:




  * [Boulder, Colorado - December 13](http://www.boulderjug.org/)


  * [Phoenix, Arizona - December 14](http://www.phxjug.org/meetings.html#next)


  * [Portland, Oregon - December 20](http://www.pjug.org/)



I hope to see you there!
