Over the next few months there are a number of great technology conferences across the globe.  I'll be speaking about Adobe AIR and Flex at:




  * [Java Posse Roundup](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/JavaPosseRoundup/) on March 3 - 6 in Crested Butte, CO


  * [TheServerSide Java Symposium](http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/html/frameworks.html#JWardFlex) on March 18 - 20 in Las Vegas


  * [Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/abstracts.php) on March 26 - 27 in Philadelphia


  * [JAOO Sydney](http://jaoo.com.au/sydney-2009/speaker/James+Ward) on May 5 - 8


  * [JAOO Brisbane](http://jaoo.com.au/brisbane-2009/speaker/James+Ward) on May 11 - 14


I'm also planning a number of Java User Group visits in March and April.  I'll post the dates for those as soon as I get them nailed down.

Hope to see you somewhere along the way!
