To celebrate the [launch of FlexMonkey 1.0](http://www.jamesward.com/blog/2009/07/14/give-your-mouse-a-break-flexmonkey-1-0-released/), Drunk on Software went to Cartman's most favorite place in the whole world - [Casa Bonita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Bonita).  And there at Casa Bonita amongst happy children and cliff divers, [Episode 14](http://www.drunkonsoftware.com/2009/07/14/episode-14-flexmonkey/) came to be.  I'm not sure if it was the margaritas, my pink feather boa, or the ambiance of Casa Bonita but this one was really fun.  So grab a marg, sit back, and drift to that happy place - it's Drunk on Software at Casa Bonita!



And please don't forget... You can drink and code but never, ever, ever drink and drive.
