Today Adobe launched [Flex 3](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/) and [Adobe AIR 1.0](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/) – the most mature and comprehensive platform for Rich Internet Applications in existence.

The news of the launch is everywhere but I wanted to point out a few of the most exciting things related to this launch.

The Flex SDK and BlazeDS are now [officially open source](http://opensource.adobe.com).

InfoQ has published an [interview with me](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/flex3-update) on the Flex 3 launch.  They have also posted an [interview with Kevin Hoyt](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/air-1.0-overview) on the AIR 1.0 launch as well as [an overview of today's announcements](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/air-flex-release).

Salesforce.com and Adobe have launched the [Force.com Toolkit for Adobe AIR and Flex](http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2008/02/25/announcing-the-forcecom-toolkit-for-adobe-air-and-flex/).

Not really related to the launch but also very exciting – Chet Haase, Java Swing guru and co-author of Filthy Rich Clients has [joined the Flex engineering team](http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-hello-world.html).

This launch is the biggest RIA launch ever!  I can't wait to see what you build with these awesome technologies!
