In the past Open Web proponents have
[criticized](http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/04/03/flash-silverlight-and-the-
open-web/) Flash and Flex because the SWF specification - while being
published and publicly available - limited what readers could do with the
specification. More specifically the agreement to view the specification
required that readers not build programs that would run SWF files. The
intentions behind this were good - Adobe does not want Flash to have
inconsistent and incompatible implementations.

Today [Adobe Systems has announced](http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/
pressreleases/200804/050108AdobeOSP.html) that they are removing those
restrictions on the SWF and FLV specifications! This is very exciting news and
something I've been lobbying for since I started working for Macromedia
(actually I think I began bugging Emmy Huang about this before I started
working for Macromedia). Flash has become the standard for sexier web
experiences with RIAs, video on the web, and interactive web content. Today
that standard is truly open!

Adobe has also announced the [Open Screen
Project](http://www.openscreenproject.org) which aims to create an open and
consistent layer on top of the countless small device platforms including
consumer devices, phones, MIDs, and set top boxes. This is an extremely
exciting project that will hopefully do for the world of small devices what
the browser did for the PC world. You could also call this the "RIA
Everywhere!" project. :)

Software keeps getting more exciting and the Open Web just got sexier and
smaller!
