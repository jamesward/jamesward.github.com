The combination of Flex and The Cloud is quickly becoming an IT and paradigm changing combination.  Here are a number of recently published resources for learning more about this :




  * An article I wrote has been published on the online Flash & Flex Developer's Magazine: [Flex and The Cloud: Is this really just Client/Server 2.0?](http://ffdmag.com/download-1-2010)


  * I'll be speaking on [Thursday, February 18 2010 at the Denver Flex User Group](http://ria5280.org/calendar/event/2010/2/18/163821) about Flex and The Cloud


  * The [recording of a webinar](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=list&loc=en_us&type=ondemand_seminar&product=&interest=int_rich_internet_applications&audience=&sdid=EGMQU) I co-hosted on the new Salesforce.com Cloud platform for developers has been posted


  * Jeff Douglas has posted [a video walk through](http://blog.jeffdouglas.com/2010/01/11/developing-apps-with-the-stratus-framework/) showing how to use the new Salesforce.com Flash Builder 4 extension for Flex + Cloud apps
