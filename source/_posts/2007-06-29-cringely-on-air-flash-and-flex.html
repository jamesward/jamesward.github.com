My all time favorite journalist, Robert X. Cringely, has just published <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070629_002360.html">his weekly PBS article</a>, this time discussing the future of Adobe's platform technologies.  It's a great read and great press for our (Adobe) platform.  Let me know what you all think about his opinions.
