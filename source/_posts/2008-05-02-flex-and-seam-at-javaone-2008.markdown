There will be numerous mini-sessions happening this year at the Adobe booth at JavaOne 2008.  I'll be doing a "Building High Performance RIAs" session and a "The Open Source RIA Stack" session.  [Chet Haase](http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/) will be doing a "Filthy Rich [Flex] Clients" session.  Bob Tierney will be doing a "LiveCycle Data Services" session and a "LiveCycle and BEA" session.  [Duane Nickull](http://technoracle.blogspot.com/) will also be doing sessions.  We also have one guest presenter, Igor Polevoy from [Exadel](http://exadel.com/), who will be demonstrating Flex and Seam integration with [Flamingo](http://flamingo.exadel.com/).  Igor's session will be at 1pm on Tuesday.  Other session times are TBD - so stop by the booth on Tuesday to pickup a schedule.  Also, make sure that you come to the Filthy Rich [Flex] Clients session with Stephan Jansen (of [Parleys.com](http://www.parleys.com/display/V21Beta/Home) and [JavaPolis](http://javapolis.com)), Chet Haase, and myself which precedes the Adobe party on Wednesday night.  Stop by the booth to pickup an invite.  See you there!

***  Quick Update: Duane will also be doing a hands-on Flex and AIR session at CommunityOne on Monday at noon.  I'll be doing a Lightning Talk at noon and hanging out with the RedMonk folks at CommunityOne.  ***
