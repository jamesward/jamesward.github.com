At JavaOne 2008 the daily edition of "JavaOne Today" features an interview
with Sun's Tor Norbye saying "Java and the Flex SDK are both open sourced. I
hope they both benefit from community involvement at whatever level people
choose to get involved."

Funny thing is that this is actually a quote from [Chet Haase](http
://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/) of Adobe which was featured in yesterday's
JavaOne Today. Whoops.

See a picture from Tor's interview below.
