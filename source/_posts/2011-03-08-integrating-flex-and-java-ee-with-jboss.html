Flex and Java have always fit together very nicely.  Connecting from Flex to a Java back-end is pretty straightforward whether you are using plain old Java beans, Spring beans, or EJB session beans.  I've created a video and some <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jbossflex/">sample code</a> that shows you how to connect Flex to a Java EE system using BlazeDS.  This video walks though a real-time collaborative Whiteboard application that runs in the browser, on the desktop, and on mobile devices.  Check out the video and let me know what you think.
