On Sunday I was in Portland for <a href="http://www.ubuntulive.com/">UbuntuLive</a>.  I had two sessions, one focused on what I call "The Irrelevant Operating System" and the other was about building cross-platform applications on Linux with Flex.  This was the second Linux conference I've spoken at.  I hope to speak at more because Linux has been an important part of my computing life.  I was trying to remember when I first started using Linux.  I think it was in 1993 around the Slackware 1.0 release.  I've used Linux as my primary desktop pretty consistently since then.  Today I use Gentoo and Ubuntu.  It's pretty exciting to see what Ubuntu is doing with Linux.  They will continue to lead the way and bring Desktop Linux to many more people.  It was a great conference and hanging out with some <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2007/07/23/some-work-and-much-play-ubuntulive-oscon/">great</a> <a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2007/07/ubuntu-live-day.html">people</a> Sunday night at Kell's Irish Pub in Portland was delightful.

Here are my slides:

<a href="/downloads/ubuntulive_rias_with_flex.pdf">Building Cross-OS Applications on Linux</a>
<a href="/downloads/ubuntulive_irrelevant_os.pdf">Success with Desktop Linux: Making Operating System Choice Irrelevant</a> (probably won't make much sense without hearing what I had to say)
