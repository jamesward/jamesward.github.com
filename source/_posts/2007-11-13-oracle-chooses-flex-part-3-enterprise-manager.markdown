At Oracle OpenWorld yesterday the Oracle Enterprise Manager team introduced their new Flex based interface for doing database query reporting.  I am very excited to see this new use of Flex within an Oracle product!  The audience was very enthusistic about features like rich data grids with tree interfaces and custom chart item renderers.  These types of interfaces make DBAs lives much easier when they need to quickly find where there are bottlenecks and problems with their Oracle database clusters.  Here is a picture from the session (courtesy of Todd Ruhl):

Exciting stuff!  And there is much more to come!
