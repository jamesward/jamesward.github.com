A few weeks ago at the [Web 2.0 Expo in
NY](http://www.web2expo.com/webexny2009/) I co-presented _The Best and Worst
Practices Building RIAs_ with [Josh Holmes](http://www.joshholmes.com). Some
would say that Josh and I evangelize competitive technologies (Silverlight and
Flex). So it's really fun for us to come together and find common ground
around building great software - no matter what technology is behind it. Here
are the slides from our presentation. Let me know what you think.
