At Oracle OpenWorld yesterday there were Flex applications EVERYWHERE! There
are even more to come today but before that I need to show off a few others
from yesterday that we were able to grab pictures of.

These days how can you do data visualization without Flex? With the number of
BI companies now using Flex it seems you can't. I'm glad to see Oracle's BI
team using Flex and I'm looking forward to seeing more sexy dashboard goodness
from them soon. Here's a rather blurry photo of the new Flex based BI
Publisher Dashboard (courtesy of Todd Ruhl):

Keep up the great work Oracle!
