Getting Flash Player working on 64-bit Linux systems has been a challenge.  But not anymore!  Today Adobe Systems [released a beta](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/) of native Flash Player 10 for 64-bit Linux!  Check it out and report bugs to the [open Flash Player bug database](https://bugs.adobe.com/flashplayer/).  Here is a short video I shot of me testing the new Flash Player 10 plugin for 64-bit Ubuntu Linux.  Let me know what you think!
