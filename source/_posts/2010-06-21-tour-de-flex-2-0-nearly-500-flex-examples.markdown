Adobe has just launched the new AIR 2 based [Tour de Flex version 2.0](http://flex.org/tour) which now contains almost 500 Flex examples!  The new version has new AIR 2 examples (only available in the AIR version of Tour de Flex) including:




  * File Promises


  * Mass Storage Detection


  * Native Process


  * Open with default app


  * Socket Server


Also there are some great examples of the new Flash Player 10.1 and AIR 2 APIs including:


  * Gestures


  * Global Error Handler


  * Globalization / Internationalization


  * Microphone access



Those are some great examples but my favorite is still [Doug McCune's](http://dougmccune.com/blog/) [Physics Form](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/tourdeflex/web/#docIndex=0;illustIndex=0;sampleId=16300) followed closely by the [real-time Tour de Flex Dashboard](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/tourdeflex/web/#docIndex=-1;illustIndex=0;sampleId=14050).  :)

If you already have Tour de Flex installed then it should auto update to the latest version when you launch it.  Otherwise install it now using the badge installer below.
