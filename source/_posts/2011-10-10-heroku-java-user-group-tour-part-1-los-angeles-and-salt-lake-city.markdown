This week I'm starting a Java User Group tour where I'll be travelling to JUGs
around the US (or maybe world). On the tour I'll be giving a talk about
**Running Java, Play! and Scala Apps on the Cloud**. Here is the description:

> Heroku is a Polyglot Cloud Application Platform that makes it easy to deploy
Java, Play! and Scala apps on the cloud. Deployment is as simple as doing a
"git push". This session will teach you how to instantly deploy and scale
Java, Play! and Scala apps on Heroku.

  
I'm still scheduling JUGs but here are the first two I'll be doing:

  * [Los Angeles JUG - October 11](http://www.lajug.org/index.html)
  * [Utah / Salt Lake City / Murray JUG - October 20](http://www.ujug.org/)
  
There will be more to come and if you'd like this talk at your local Java User
Group, let your leader know and have them email me: jw <at> heroku <dot> com

Hopefully see you at your local JUG!
