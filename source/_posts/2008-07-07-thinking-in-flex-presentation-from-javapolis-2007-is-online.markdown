The Thinking in Flex keynote which [Bruce
Eckel](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=234135), [Christoph
Rooms](http://christophrooms.com/), and I did at JavaPolis 2007 has been
posted! [Check it out!](http://parleys.com/display/PARLEYS/Home#slide=1;talk=1
5138862;title=Thinking in Flex)

Let me know what you think.

BTW: Don't you love that [Parleys.com](http://www.parleys.com) is a Flex
app?!? And they also have an Adobe AIR version of their app which works pretty
well on Linux. (To install the Parleys AIR app on Linux install [Adobe AIR for
Linux](http://labs.adobe.com) and then get [the Parleys .air
file](http://www.parleys.com/download/attachments/3440646/Pandora.air).)
