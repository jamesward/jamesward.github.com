As a companion to our book, [First Steps in Flex](http://www.firststepsinflex.com), Bruce Eckel and I have recorded [some screencasts](http://www.firststepsinflex.com/#chapters) which walk through the code samples in the book.  Let us know what you think about these first few.  The rest will be posted sometime in the next few months.
