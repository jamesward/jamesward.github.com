A few weeks ago I was able to participate in a Chalk Talk with Salesforce.com and StakeWare.  The session focused on how Rich Internet Applications, Flex, and Adobe AIR relate to the Force.com platform.  With this combination of technologies companies like StakeWare can quickly build business applications that have rich user interfaces that work the same across browsers and operating systems.

PodTech recorded the session and have split it into three parts [[part1](http://www.podtech.net/home/4494/forcecom-chalk-talk-salesforcecom-adobe-and-stakeware), [part2](http://www.podtech.net/home/4509/forcecom-chalk-talk-salesforcecom-adobe-and-stakeware-part-2), [part3](http://www.podtech.net/home/4510/forcecom-chalk-talk-salesforcecom-adobe-and-stakeware-part-3)].  I spoke in part 2.  You can watch the video below or on the PodTech site.
