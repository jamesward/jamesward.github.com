JavaOne 2008 begins in just over a week!  Adobe is a sponsor again so you will find me in the booth when I'm not out at the many JavaOne parties.  On Wednesday night Adobe will be hosting their party at Jillian's.  Preceding the party <a href="http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/">Chet Haase</a> and I will be presenting a quick, fun session about Flex.  More details at <a href="http://flex.org/javaone">http://flex.org/javaone</a>

Also on Monday at <a href="http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/">CommunityOne</a> I'll be doing a Lightning Talk and participating in a panel.

I hope to see you there!
