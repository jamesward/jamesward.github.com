A little over a year ago [Bruce Eckel](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Index.php) and I published [First Steps in Flex](http://www.firststepsinflex.com).  So far we've had great feedback on the book.  The concise examples seem to resonate with how developers learn new technologies.  Another way that developers learn is through seeing technologies firsthand.  To better support that model of learning Bruce and I decided to create [screencasts](http://www.firststepsinflex.com) for each chapter of the book.

We took a very casual approach to the screencasts.  They were not scripted.  We wanted them to feel as though you are sitting in the room with us as we discuss the code.  Check them out and let us know what you think.

BTW: The viewer app for the screencasts was created with Flex 4!
