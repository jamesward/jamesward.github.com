With the recent beta releases of [Flash Builder 4](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashbuilder4/) and [Flash Catalyst](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashcatalyst/) there is a lot of fun stuff going on.  Next week I'll be speaking in Zurich at Jazoon on Tuesday about [RIAs with Java, Spring, Hibernate, BlazeDS, and Flex](http://jazoon.com/en/conference/presentationdetails.html?type=sid&detail=6662).  On Wednesday I'll be speaking in Copenhagen about [Flex 4 and Flash Catalyst](http://groups.adobe.com/posts/30ecd71201).  Thursday I'm back in Zurich speaking about [Flex 4](http://groups.adobe.com/posts/8567335b9f).  And finally on Friday I'll be speaking at [Flash at the Lake](http://fatl.ch/?page_id=136&lang=en-us) about Pixel Bender and [pbjAS](http://www.jamesward.com/blog/2009/04/29/announcing-pbjas-an-actionscript-3-pixel-bender-shader-library/).  Lots of fun stuff!  I hope to see some of you along the way.
