Salesforce.com is putting on a [great event](https://www.developerforce.com/ev
ents/sanmateo_developer_meetup/registration.php) on August 25 in San Mateo,
California where you can learn about how to build RIAs on the Cloud with
[Flash Builder for Force.com](http://developer.force.com/flashbuilder). This
will be a great opportunity to meet the team that built the tool and learn how
to use it! If you can't make it then check out the article I recently
published "[Building Client / Cloud Apps with Flash Builder for
Force.com](http://www.jamesward.com/2010/07/26/building-client-cloud-apps-
with-flash-builder-for-force-com/)". But if you are in the Bay Area and want
to get up to speed quickly on building Client / Cloud apps then [Register Now]
