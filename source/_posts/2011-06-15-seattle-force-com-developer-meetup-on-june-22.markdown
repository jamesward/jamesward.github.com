Next week I'll be presenting in Seattle at my first [Force.com Developer Meetu
p](http://www.developerforce.com/events/seattle_developer_meetup/registration.
php?d=70130000000G4WO)! It starts at 6pm on Wednesday, June 22. My session
will be on Flex Mobile Development. Other sessions include Force.com Platform
Basics, Native iOS Development using JavaScript, and a Force.com Hands-On Lab.
It's going to be a fun evening, so if you are in the Seattle area, then I hope
to see you there!
