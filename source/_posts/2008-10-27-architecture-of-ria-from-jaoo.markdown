At the [JAOO](http://jaoo.dk/aarhus-2008/conference/) conference in Aarhus, Denmark I was able to co-present with [Josh Holmes](http://www.joshholmes.com) from Microsoft about the Architecture of RIA.  This presentation was technology agnostic so we didn't talk about specific implementations using platforms like Flex / Flash or Silverlight.  Josh has posted the presentation slides and detailed notes on his blog:
