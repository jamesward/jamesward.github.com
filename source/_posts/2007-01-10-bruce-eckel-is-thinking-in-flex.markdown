Update: You can download the source code for this screencast [here](/downloads/flex_and_tg-address_example.zip).

Recently Bruce Eckel and I had the chance to record a screencast of us pair programming with Flex & TurboGears:

The results were great - a fantastic UI on top of a simple back-end!  Both Bruce and I learned a lot creating this screencast and I hope you will enjoy watching it.
