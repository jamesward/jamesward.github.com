As a companion to our book, <a href="http://www.firststepsinflex.com">First Steps in Flex</a>, Bruce Eckel and I have recorded <a href="http://www.firststepsinflex.com/#chapters">some screencasts</a> which walk through the code samples in the book.  Let us know what you think about these first few.  The rest will be posted sometime in the next few months.
