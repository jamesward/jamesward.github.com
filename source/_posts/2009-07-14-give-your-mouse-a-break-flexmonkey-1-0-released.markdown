Typically when I develop Flex apps for the browser or the desktop (via Adobe AIR) I do a lot of clicking to test every change I make.  My mouse gets a little worn out and I waste a lot of time.  Luckily there is a better way to test Flex apps.  Flex supports automated testing of applications but you need software that does the record, playback, and test validation.  [FlexMonkey](http://www.gorillalogic.com/stuff.flexmonkey.html) is a free and open source tool that does automated testing on Flex apps.  It just reached the [1.0 release](http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/07/flex-monkey-1.0-released) and it now contains a number of new great features like:





  * Fluint / FlexUnit 4 Test Creation


  * Ant and Hudson / CI Support


  * Property and Bitmap Verification



If you'd like to learn more about how to use FlexMonkey check out "[Testing Flex applications with FlexMonkey 1.0](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/flexmonkey.html)" by Eric Owens.  FlexMonkey is a great tool that will give your mouse a break and save you some time.  Check it out and let me know what you think.
