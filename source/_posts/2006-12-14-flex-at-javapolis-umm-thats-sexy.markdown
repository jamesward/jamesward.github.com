[Christoph Rooms](http://www.christophrooms.com/) and I have been showing off Flex all week at [JavaPolis](http://www.javapolis.com).  Everyone is loving it!  Check out the crowd of people watching demos and winning shwag (click the image below to see more pictures from JavaPolis):

This week at the conference [Jon from BEA](http://dev2dev.bea.com/blog/jonmountjoy/) even built a Flex app with vi and the free Flex SDK!  Nice work Jon!

Last night Christoph and I built a little Flex app with Ely Greenfield's [FishEye component](http://www.quietlyscheming.com/blog/components/fisheye-component/), to show all the people who have visited our booth:
