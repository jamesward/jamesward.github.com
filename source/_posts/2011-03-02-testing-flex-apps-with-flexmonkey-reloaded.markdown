Whether or not you use a tool to test your Flex apps, you are repeatedly testing your application.  Doing this by hand is a pain: start the app, click through some stuff, verify the result is what you expected, makes some changes to your code and then do it all again.  The open source [FlexMonkey](http://www.gorillalogic.com/flexmonkey) tool automates that process so you don't have to keep doing those steps manually.  FlexMonkey works with Flex applications that run in the browser (Flash Player) as well as on the desktop (Adobe AIR).  [Jon Rose](http://www.gorillajawn.com) has just finished a [complete overhaul of FlexMonkey](http://www.gorillajawn.com/wordpress/2011/02/24/flexmonkey-reloaded-beta/) that makes automating your Flex testing process uber-simple and much more robust than the previous version.

Jon and I have created some resources to help get you started using FlexMonkey.  Start by reading the [Introduction to Flex and AIR Testing with FlexMonkey](http://www.artima.com/articles/intro_to_flex_monkey.html).  Then check out a short screencast I did that walks through the FlexMonkey basics:

  

To continue learning check out a series of videos from Jon that will give you a more in-depth look at each piece of FlexMonkey:
