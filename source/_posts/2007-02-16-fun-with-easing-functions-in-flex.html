Last week I was doing an impromptu session at <a href="http://www.silvafug.org/">Slivafug</a> when I discovered Easing Functions in Flex.  I love it when after almost three years with a technology I can still just stumble across something amazingly cool!  Easing functions allow you to apply non-linear motion to effects.  There are many types of effects which you could apply easing functions to, but I've only touched the surface by playing with Move effects and Series Interpolation on charts.  I've created a little demo application to show off Flex's built-in easing functions:
<a href="/easingFunctionFun/easingFunctionFun.html">Fun with Easing Functions Demo</a>

This application was very simple to build.  You can get the source via right-click in the demo, or <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/easingFunctionFun/srcview/index.html">here</a>.  Have fun with those Easing Functions!
