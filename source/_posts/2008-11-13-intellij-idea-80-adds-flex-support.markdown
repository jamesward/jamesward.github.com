[IntelliJ IDEA 8.0](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/index.html), the popular Java IDE, has been released and now supports building and debugging Flex applications.  This is great validation of Flex's momentum in the Java community.  For more information on how to get started see "[Creating Flex Applications with IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/Creating_Flex_Applications_with_IntelliJ_IDEA.pdf)".
