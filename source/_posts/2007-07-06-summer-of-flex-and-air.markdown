There is a ton of great Flex and AIR events going on over the next few months.  Here's the run down of events I'll be at:

The [FREE Flex Camp](http://flexcamp.eventbrite.com/) is July 27th in San Francisco.  This is going to be a great way to learn more about Flex.  Spots are going fast so go register today!  I'll be at this event so hopefully I will get to meet some of you in person.

The [onAIR Bus Tour](http://onair.adobe.com/) starts July 10th and will hit 18 cities in North America.  These events are going to be off-the-hook.  I'm hoping to spend some time on the bus, but not sure when yet.

My favorite events of the summer will be the two being hosted by Bruce Eckel in Crested Butte, Colorado.  I've always loved CB no matter what the season.  But honestly, these events will change your life.  :)  The first Bruce Eckel hosted event I ever went to was one of those defining moments. It was like the light bulb went on and I realized that this is how all conferences should be run.  Ya see... Bruce does [Open Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) style events.  These events are absolutely the best way to learn because you learn through interaction, trial & error, and conversation.  In other words, you make connections, not just in reality, but also in the gray matter of your head.  Have I convinced you yet?  I hope so.  You won't be let down by these events.  Anyways, here they are:

[Flex & AIR Jam](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/FlexApolloJam/Index.php) (August 13-14) Two days of hands-on coding with peers and experts.  No matter what your level of experience with Flex & AIR you will leave this event knowing a ton more.  Besides what could be better than two days in CB with Bruce and I?  ;)

[RIA Summit](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/RIA/Index.php) (August 15-17) Three days of discussion around RIA and the future of web & desktop software with some of the folks who are behind the movement.  You don't want to miss this event.  Pair this with the Flex & AIR Jam and you get five fabulous days in CB with Bruce & I!  ;)  Seriously though...  This event will unforgettable.
  

If that wasn't enough summer madness for you there is more...

I'm speaking at the [Kansas City JUG](http://kcjava.org/kcjava.htm) on July 11th.

Then out to Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina to present at the [Triangle JUG](http://trijug.org/meetinginfo.jsp?date=2007-07) on July 16th.

The next day, July 17th, Andy Oliver and I will be hosting a [Flex Sprint](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/215190/?ps=5) at the [buni.org](http://buni.org) offices.

On July 19th I'll be in Phoenix presenting at the [Phoenix Flex User Group](http://www.phxflex.org/) for their inaugural meeting.

And on July 22 I have two sessions at [Ubuntu Live](http://www.ubuntulive.com/cs/ubuntu/view/e_spkr/3640).

Wow!  There is a ton going on this summer!  Tons of great opportunities for you to engage with others, learn more about Flex and AIR, and let me take you out for a beer!  Hope to see you at one (or all) of those events!

If you can't make it to any of those events I'll be really bummed, but you could [join us over the web](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=462539&loc=en_us).
  

Oh and don't forget...  [MAX 2007 is coming Sept 30 - Oct 3](http://www.adobemax2007.com/)!
