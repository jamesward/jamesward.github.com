This week at Mobile World Congress Adobe has been [showing off Flash Player 10.1](http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/201002/021510FlashPlayerMWC.html) on a variety of mobile devices.  Last week I received Google's Nexus One device with an early version of Flash Player 10.1 on it.  Here is a video I shot today showing how Flex applications can run on mobile devices with Flash Player 10.1 and how existing applications can be tweaked for the size constraints of these devices.  Let me know what you think.

BTW: The app I created for the demo is available at [bit.ly/tdfmdb](http://bit.ly/tdfmdb).
