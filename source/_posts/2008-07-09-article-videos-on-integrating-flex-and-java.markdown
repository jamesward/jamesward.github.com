This week I'm in Europe [speaking at various Java User
Groups](http://www.jamesward.com/wordpress/2008/07/07/europe_jug_tour/) about
integrating Flex and Java. I tend to move quickly through code demos so many
people have asked me how they can continue learning. Here are a few resources
to get you started:

AMF](http://www.infoq.com/articles/blazeds-intro)

Hopefully that is enough to get you started. Have fun and let me know how it
goes!
