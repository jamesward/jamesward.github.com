Since I'm frequently at conferences meeting cool people I thought it would be fun to start recording videos of some of the great things I get to see in my travels.  For lack of a more creative title I'm just calling these "RIA Cowboy Videos".  This first video is from AjaxWorld 2008 where I had the guys from [Neotys](http://www.neotys.com/) talk about and show off their product [NeoLoad](http://www.neotys.com/load-testing-tool/Overview.html?from=mid), that load tests Flex applications.  Interestingly I just watched a [screencast](http://myflex.org//demos/JettyBlazeDS/JettyBlazeDSloadTest.html) by the [Farata Systems](http://www.faratasystems.com/) guys where they used NeoLoad to load test BlazeDS on Jetty using the new Servlet 3 NIO stuff.  Detailed article [here](http://flex.sys-con.com/node/720304).

Here's the video.  Let me know what you think!

BTW: I'm a total video novice so the quality of these videos will hopefully improve over time.  I've already purchased a new Bluetooth mic, which should improve the sound quality in future videos.
