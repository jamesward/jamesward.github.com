While I was attending the Java Posse Roundup 2009 I was able to give a
5-minute Lightning Talk about Flex. There are now so many amazing things to
show with Flex that it's really hard to narrow down what will be the most
compelling. In [past
years](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUaM9CADiU&feature=channel_page) I
showed more code and useful things. But this year I wanted to just make
people's jaws drop.

First I showed the [Tour de Flex](http://flex.org/tour) application to
encourage all of the attendees to go explore some great Flex components on
their own. I also wanted to show off the new 3D APIs in Flash Player 10 so I
showed Justin Everett Church's [Cloth Demo](http://justin.everett-
church.com/fp10demos/cloth.html). Then I showed a prototype of an Adobe AIR
based catalog for the Anthropologie women's clothing store.

At the end I really wanted to WOW everyone so I showed some of the
[FLARToolkit](http://www.libspark.org/wiki/saqoosha/FLARToolKit/en)
[demos](http://flash.tarotaro.org/blog/) followed by a custom application that
I built using the FLARToolkit. The application I built scrolls up and down in
a datagrid using the position of a marker which is being captured by the web
cam. It's hard to explain so you will just have to check out the video. Let me
know what you think.
