This week at the Google I/O conference Adobe announced that a Flash Player
10.1 beta and an Adobe AIR prerelease are now available for Android devices.
This is really exciting news for those of us building apps on the Flash
Platform because now we can begin building apps in Flex for these mobile
devices (and many others coming soon).

Take a look a some of the quick demos I've built with Flex running on Android
in Flash Player and AIR:  You can get the source code for all of these demos
from [github](http://github.com/jamesward).

Also [Christophe Coenraets](http://coenraets.org) has posted some great Flex
mobile demos. Check out his [Employee
Directory](http://coenraets.org/blog/2010/05/sample-application-using-flex-
and-air-for-android/) and [Stock Trader](http://coenraets.org/blog/2010/05
/android-trader-application-with-flex-4-and-air/) demos.

These are very exciting times for developers!

If you want to check out the Flash Player 10.1 beta for Android it will be
available in the Android Marketplace for Android 2.2 devices. You can try
Adobe AIR for Android today by [signing up for the
prerelease](http://blogs.adobe.com/air/2010/05/air_android_prerelease.html).
