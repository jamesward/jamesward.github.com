In Ed Abbo's keynote at Oracle OpenWorld on Tuesday, Oracle announced two new products that are built with Flex.  The first, Sales Prospector, will go live in the first half of 2008.  The Sales Prospector helps companies make better sales forecasts and in the words of Larry Ellison the software will "help the salesperson sell" instead of just forecast.  The demo looked great!  I can't wait to try it out!  Here is a photo from the keynote (courtesy of Todd Ruhl):
