Client + Cloud technologies have been quickly evolving and maturing.  The combination of Flex and Salesforce.com continue to lead the way for next generation Client + Cloud applications.  Recently I did a <a href="http://seminars.adobe.acrobat.com/p26603860/">Webinar on The Flash Platform and Salesforce.com</a> with Dave Carroll from Salesforce.  If you missed it you can watch the recording to see how you can begin developing Client + Cloud apps.  Also <a href="http://blog.jeffdouglas.com/2010/02/01/adobe-air-applications-with-salesforce/">watch Jeff Douglas demo an offline case management app</a> he built with Flex and Force.com.  Awesome stuff!

Last week I was able to spend a few hours with <a href="http://www.modelmetrics.com">Model Metrics</a> porting their <a href="http://www.modelmetrics.com/solutions/2go-mobile-cloud-platform/">Pharma2GO Adobe AIR app</a> to run on an Android Mobile device.  Using the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air2/android/">AIR for Android Prerelease</a> we quickly created a mobile friendly UI with Flex and reused the same data sync code from the desktop app.  Check out the end result:

Listen to what Model Metrics had to say about this in their blog "<a href="http://www.modelmetrics.com/general/html-5-%E2%80%93-ready-for-primetime-in-the-enterprise/">HTML 5 â€“ Ready for Primetime in the Enterprise?</a>":
<blockquote>One of our early iPhone products on the iTunes AppStore was Search2GO, a simple search tool for Salesforce.com.  This was built in Objective C and it took approximately 8 weeks to develop.  Yesterday I watched two developers create over half of this same functionality using Flex/AIR and had it running on an Android phone in a day.  Granted there are still things that could be added, but this was a great illustration of why Flex/AIR is a great toolset.</blockquote>

These are exciting times for Client + Cloud apps now that the "Client" can easily be on the web, desktop, and mobile device using the same technologies and tools!
