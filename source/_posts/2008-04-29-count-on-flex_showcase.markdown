**326** = Number of Flex applications in the [Flex.org Showcase](http://flex.org/showcase/).  
Many Flex applications either require authentication or are behind firewalls.
However the [Flex.org Showcase](http://flex.org/showcase/) lists publicly
available Flex applications. If your Flex application is not listed, go [add
it today](http://flex.org/showcase/howto.php)!

That's **326** more reasons you can Count on Flex!

"Count on Flex" is a series of blogs about the current state of the Flex
ecosystem... by the numbers.
