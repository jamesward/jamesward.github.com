A little over a year ago Adobe opened the [AMF
spec](http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/amf/amf3_spec_121207.pdf). Now
Adobe [has announced](http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/
200901/012009RTMP.html) it will be opening the RTMP spec! Wahoo!!! This is big
news for Flex developers! For those that don't know, RTMP is the streaming
protocol used for streaming video and audio in Flash Media Server and for
streaming data in LiveCycle Data Services. The spec is expected to be
published first half of this year.
