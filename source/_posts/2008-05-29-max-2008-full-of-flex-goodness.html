Adobe MAX is a special time of year.  Kind-of like getting together the family for Christmas...  Lots of drinking, carousing, and the gift of inspiring Flex talks by people like <a href="http://www.quietlyscheming.com/blog/">Ely Greenfield</a> and <a href="http://coenraets.org/">Christophe Coenraets</a>.

This year festivities take place November 16 - 19 at Moscone in San Francisco.  Moscone has become like my second home so I'm glad to yet again visit that little village by the sea.  Best thing about Moscone is the number of Starbucks within a block of the place.

Last year sold out fast, so <a href="http://max.adobe.com/blog/">go register today</a>!
