As of yesterday, for the first time EVER, nearly everyone in the world has access to a **FREE**, **ubiquitous** application runtime, and a **FREE** application development toolkit for that runtime!  Of course I'm referring to [Flash Player 9](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html) and the [free Flex 2 SDK](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_2_for_Linux).  To show people the power of these two technologies I've recorded a screen cam of me building a YouTube video player on Linux.  Check it out!
