Ever since I got into Macromedia Flex I have not been able to view .mxml applications in any Mozilla based browser on Linux.  Mozilla for some reason cuts off the Flash at around 240 pixels in width.  I have searched the web and Mozilla's Bugzilla trying to find others who have also experienced this problem.  I haven't found much.  A few Mozilla bugs seem to indicate others had this same problem.  But not enough for anyone at Mozilla or even Macromedia to care.  There has only been 1 post about this issue on the flexcoders Yahoo list.  So not really a big deal, except to those of us on Linux!

It seems that the problem is with percentage width embedded objects inside percentage width tables.  When writing mxml applications I can easily work around the issue by not using a table.  However, anytime I view someone else's application who has not worked around this bug, I only see the left 240 pixels of the application.  I could try to file a bug with Mozilla, but I think that's been done and didn't get the issue resolved.  Greasemonkey to the rescue!

Greasemonkey is a Firefox extension which lets me easily manipulate web pages when they are loaded in my browser.  So I wrote a simple Greasemonkey script which fixes the problem!  Fo those interested, here is what you need to do...
<div align="left">Install the Greasemonkey extension from: <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/</a>
Install my user script from: <a href="http://www.cayambe.com/fix_embed_percentage_bug.user.js">http://www.cayambe.com/fix_embed_percentage_bug.user.js</a>
Go to: <a href="http://flexapps.macromedia.com/flex15/explorer/explorer.mxml">http://flexapps.macromedia.com/flex15/explorer/explorer.mxml</a></div>
or any other Flex application and you should see the full application!

My script is just a hack.  If you have any ideas for improving it, please let me know!
