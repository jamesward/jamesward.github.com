[Devoxx](http://devoxx.com/) is an annual developer conference in Antwerp, Belgium. Devoxx is typically held at the coldest, most miserable time of year to allow attendees to concentrate on the most important thing: Belgian Beer. Drunk on Softwareâ€™s, [Chet Haase](http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/), was at the conference this year, talking to various people in bars, in restaurants, and in bars about what they were interested in drinking, er, enjoying at the conference this year.
