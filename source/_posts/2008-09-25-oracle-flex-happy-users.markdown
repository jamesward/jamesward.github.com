This week I've been at Oracle OpenWorld checking out all of the new applications Oracle has been building with Flex.  Some of these seem to be integrating Flex and ADF which is a great combination of technologies!  I've recorded videos of some of these applications which I hope to edit and publish here soon.  One of those videos will feature the [new Oracle MetaLink](https://metalink.oracle.com), which is a fantastic Flex application (details on [Edwin Biemond's blog](http://biemond.blogspot.com/2008/07/try-new-oracle-metalink-site-build-in.html)).

It's great to see Oracle doing amazing things with Flex!  And it's also great to see the community getting excited about the combination of Oracle technologies and Flex.  While walking around OpenWorld I noticed a random whiteboard:
![Oracle + Flex = Happy Users](http://www.jamesward.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/oracle_flex_happy_users.jpg)

Three-tier client/server architectures using Oracle and Flex result in happy users! Wahoo!!!
