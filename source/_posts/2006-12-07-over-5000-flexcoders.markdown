I just noticed that the [flexcoders Yahoo!
Group](http://groups.yahoo.com/search?query=flexcoders) now has over 5000
members! That's pretty amazing! This list was founded almost 3 years ago on
March 17, 2004. But my [first
post](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/flexcoders/message/8291) wasn't until
January 17, 2005. So I am but a newbie. Congrats to all those early founders
who started the revolution and have continued answering questions for years
and years. A special shout-out to [Matt
Chotin](http://flickr.com/photos/mdowney/212801231/) who has posted 3407
messages! Wow!
