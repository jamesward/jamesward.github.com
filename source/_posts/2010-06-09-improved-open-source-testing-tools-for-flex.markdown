Back in the early days of Flex there wasn't much for doing unit testing, automated testing, performance testing, etc.  Thanks to the community there are now numerous open source testing tools for Flex.  Here are some recent updates you should definitely check out if you are building production Flex apps:




  * [FlexUnit 4.1 Beta 1](http://www.flexunit.org/?p=62)


  * [FlexMonkey (open source automated testing) now supports Flex 4](http://flexmonkey.org/wordpress/2010/05/11/flex-4-support-now-available-from-flexmonkey-gorilla-logic/)


  * [PushButton Labs Profiler for Flex](http://pushbuttonengine.com/2010/06/pushbutton-labs-profiler-open-sourced/)



It's very exciting to see these community driven projects continue to improve testing for Flex apps.
