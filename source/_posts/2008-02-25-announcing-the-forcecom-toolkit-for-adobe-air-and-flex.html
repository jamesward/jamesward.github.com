Almost a year ago I began working with Ron Hess and Dave Carroll from Salesforce on the Flex Toolkit for Apex - a port of the JavaScript libraries for Salesforce.com's web services.  Since that time the toolkit has matured and been used in numerous production applications.  Today I am pleased to announce the new Force.com Toolkit for Adobe AIR and Flex.  This new toolkit build on the Flex Toolkit for Apex and adds additional functionality for the new Adobe AIR runtime for desktop RIAs.

For more information on the new toolkit check out <a href="https://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/AIR_and_Flex_Toolkit">a tutorial I wrote</a> on how to use it.  Also visit <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/salesforce/">the new Salesforce page on the Adobe Developer Connection</a>.

It was very impressive seeing all of the amazing applications that were built with the original toolkit.  I can't wait to see what you build with this new toolkit.  Let us know how it goes!
