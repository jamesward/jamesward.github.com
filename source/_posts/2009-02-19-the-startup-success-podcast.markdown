I was recently able to be a guest on [The Startup Success Podcast](http://startuppodcast.wordpress.com/2009/02/15/show-15-james-ward-adobe-technical-evangelist/).  I talked with Bob and Patrick about my usual topics: Rich Internet Applications, Flex, Adobe AIR, etc.  It was a very enjoyable chat.  Give it a listen and let me know what you think.
