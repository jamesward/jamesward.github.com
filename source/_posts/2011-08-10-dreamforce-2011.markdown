I'm very excited to be presenting at
[Dreamforce](http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF11/) (salesforce.com's
anual conference) this year! On Thursday, September 1, from 1:15 pm to 2:15 pm
I will be presenting:

> **Developing Java Cloud Apps** The cloud makes it easy to deploy highly
scalable apps in an instant. This session will walk you through the steps to
build your first Java app for the cloud. You'll also learn best practices for
building mission-critical and horizontally scalable Java cloud apps.

  
Then on Friday, September 2, from 10:00 am to 11:00 am I will be hosting a
panel discussion:

> **Fireside Chat: Java on the Cloud** Come join the Java on the cloud product
managers, architects, and experts for a casual, unscripted chat to find out
how Java developers can best take advantage of the cloud. The session will be
a mix of preselected and audience-provided questions. So bring all your tough,
interesting, and quirky questions to this Fireside Chat.

  
I hope to see you there!
