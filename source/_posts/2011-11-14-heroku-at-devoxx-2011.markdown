[Devoxx](http://devoxx.com) is one of my favorite conferences of the year so
I'm lucky to be presenting there again this year. This [Thursday at
noon](http://devoxx.com/display/DV11/Conf+Day+4) I'll be presenting about
Heroku and how to [deploy Java, Play Framework, and Scala apps on the
cloud](http://devoxx.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5015973). Hopefully see
you there!
