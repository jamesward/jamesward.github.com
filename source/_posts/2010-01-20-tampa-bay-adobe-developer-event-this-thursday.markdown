Adobe's Enterprise Evangelism team including [Greg Wilson](http://gregsramblings.com), [Christophe Coenraets](http://coenraets.org), and myself are in Tampa, FL this week.  On Thursday night we are [rounding up the local geeks](http://gregsramblings.com/2010/01/18/tampa-bay-adobe-developer-event-this-thursday/) at Taverna Opa for free beers and drunken confabulation about Flex, The Flash Platform, and other topics that bore most normal people.  Hope to see you there!
