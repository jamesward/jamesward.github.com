JetBrains [just announced](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2011/10/play-with-intellij-idea-eap-build-110187/) that they have [posted a new EAP release](http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/IDEADEV/IDEA+11+EAP) of IntelliJ IDEA that supports [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.org) apps!  Here is a quick video I recorded that shows how to get IntelliJ setup with a Play app:
