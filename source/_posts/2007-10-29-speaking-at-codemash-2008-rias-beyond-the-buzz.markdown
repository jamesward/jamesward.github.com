![](http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-
content/uploads/2007/10/codemash_logo.gif)I just received notification that I
was accepted as a speaker for [CodeMash 2008](http://www.codemash.org/)! This
will be my second year speaking about Flex at CodeMash. Last year was a ton of
fun! Between sessions we would head down to the indoor water park for an Open
Spaces session on the Lazy River or for some great conversations while waiting
in line to try surfing the standing wave. There were a ton of fun people at
the conference and we even had some time to do an Open Spaces session on
[using Flex and TurboGears
together](http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2007/01/20/flex-and-turbogears-
at-codemash-displayshelf-widget/). This year I'll be speaking about Flex and
Adobe AIR in a session named "RIAs - Beyond the Buzz". With lots of great
people and an indoor water park, CodeMash 2008 is a conference you definitely
don't want to miss!
