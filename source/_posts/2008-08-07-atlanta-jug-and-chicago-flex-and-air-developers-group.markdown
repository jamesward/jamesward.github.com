In a few weeks I'll be stopping by the Atlanta Java User Group and the Chicago Flex and AIR Developers Group:

Atlanta - August 19, 2008 - [Rich Internet Applications with Flex and Java](http://www.ajug.org/confluence/display/AJUG/Home)

Chicago - August 20, 2008 - [The Future of Flex, Flash Player, and AIR](http://chicagoflex.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=63:next-meeting-wed-82008-530-pm&catid=45:upcoming&Itemid=68)

Hope to see you there!
