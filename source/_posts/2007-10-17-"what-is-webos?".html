Remember the days when JBoss was marketed as a "webOS"?  In case you don't there is great post by <a href="http://marcf.blogspot.com/">Marc Fluery</a> in response to the question "<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=KFEIJKDHENKHOCLAOGKGAEOICNAA.marc.fleury%40jboss.org">What is webOS?</a>".  Marc had a vision for the future but he was way ahead of his time.  Before Marc stumbled onto the "Professional Open Source" business model he ultimately wanted to build what today is salesforce.com.  I remember him trying to sell me he and Rickard's plan...  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000823054544/http://telkel.com/">Telkel</a>.  I had created a small Java web hosting service called wantJava.  We began offering JBoss hosting after hosting servlets since the Sun Java Web Server 1.0 days.  Under the business name Telkel, Marc and Rickard ultimately wanted to build an application hosting service.  JBoss of-course was the critical piece of infrastructure which would run this application hosting cloud.  Marc foresaw a world where you wouldn't have to worry about managing server, databases, or networks.  Just upload your EAR (Enterprise ARchive) file to the cloud and it will be distributed and managed for you.
