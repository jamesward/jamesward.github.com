It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling when the guy I learned Java web programming
with starts saying things like:

"[For me, Flex is clearly the way to go.](http://ectropic.com/wordpress/?p=3)"

The whole article is a great read for those evaluating the Rich Internet
Application landscape.

Jon, we are glad to have you "Thinking in Flex" and can't wait to see what you
build!
