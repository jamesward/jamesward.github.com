An article titled "[From Tags to Riches: Going from Web 1.0 to Flex](http://www.infoq.com/articles/web-flex-port)" which I co-authored with [Shashank Tiwari](http://www.shanky.org/) has been [published on InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/articles/web-flex-port).  In the article, Shashank and I walk through the steps needed to port a traditional HTML-based application to Flex.  We use the Java-based [Pentaho BI Dashboard](http://www.pentaho.org/) as our example application.  Our goal in writing the article was to make the process easy for anyone to try on their own. It should be easy to try it yourself -- just download the code and other necessary pieces.  Also, if you want to play with the end result, you can access the Flex application [here](http://www.jamesward.org/pentaho_dashboard/pentaho_dashboard_demo.html).  Let us know what you think.

[Update: Shashank's [blog post about the article](http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2008/02/from_tags_to_riches_going_from.html) made me realize that I forgot to mention I will be presenting on this topic at [JBoss World](http://www.jbossworld.com/agenda/thursday.html#next_thurs_10) this week but using the [JBoss JMX Console](http://www.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JMXConsole) as the example application.  Thanks Shashank for including that!]
