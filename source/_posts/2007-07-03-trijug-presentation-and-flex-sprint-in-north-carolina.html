On July 16th I will be presenting at the <a href="http://trijug.org/">TriJUG</a> in North Carolina beginning at 6:30pm.  There will be some great give-aways including a copy of <a href="http://www.flex.org">Flex Builder 2</a>.  Then on Tuesday July 17th, <a href="http://www.buni.org">buni.org</a> and I will be hosting a half day Flex <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints">Sprint</a> in Durham.  This will be a great opportunity to get some hands-on Flex training, FOR FREE!  <a href="http://blog.buni.org/blog/default/">Andy Oliver</a> and I will be helping as many people who show up, learn Flex.  You just need to bring a laptop (with power adapter & wireless).  Festivities begin at 8:30 and end at noon.  We will meet on the lower floor of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=bean+traders+coffee&sll=36.008189,-78.922131&sspn=0.001616,0.002293&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=19&iwloc=A&om=1">Bean Traders Coffee</a>.
