Last night I created a simple WYSIWYG tool based on Flex, inspired in part by
the [Zamples](http://www.zamples.com/) idea of [Live Code
Examples](http://zamples.com/JspExplorer/samples/index.jsp). The goal is to do
on-the-fly conversion of simple markup to Flash objects. This code is
particularly useful for environments where content management is seperate from
the web application. This is pretty basic and there may be better ways to do
this, but I hadn't seen this done before so I took a stab at it. Feel free to
suggest improvements!

Here's the source code:

Let me know what you think!
