Back in the day Swing was so cool because you could make your app [look like a
napkin](http://napkinlaf.sourceforge.net/). Of course most of us don't think
much about desktop apps or applets anymore, so the Napkin craze faded away.
But I'm here to say that [The Napkin Skin is back and better than
ever](http://www.thebetterside.com/scrawl/ScrawlExample4.html)! And now it's
based on web technology that people actually have and use. For more info about
how [Eylon Stroh](http://onreflexion.blogspot.com/) created this work of art,

skins](http://onreflexion.blogspot.com/2007/01/napkin-skins-stage-one-css-
