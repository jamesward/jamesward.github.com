The second Flex application which Oracle demonstrated at Ed Abbo's keynote on
Tuesday was Sales Library. The Sales Library helps sales people organize and
share their sales content. The interface is very clean and elegant. The
transitions are smooth and useful. Very impressive stuff! Here is a photo of
the Sales Library demo from Oracle OpenWorld (courtesy of Todd Ruhl):

Still one more Oracle Flex application left to announce. Stay tuned.
