Flex and Java have always fit together very nicely. Connecting from Flex to a
Java back-end is pretty straightforward whether you are using plain old Java
beans, Spring beans, or EJB session beans. I've created a video and some
[sample code](http://code.google.com/p/jbossflex/) that shows you how to
connect Flex to a Java EE system using BlazeDS. This video walks though a
real-time collaborative Whiteboard application that runs in the browser, on
the desktop, and on mobile devices. Check out the video and let me know what
you think.
