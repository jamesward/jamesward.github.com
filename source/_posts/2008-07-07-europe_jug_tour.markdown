The last few weeks my wife and I have been tromping around the Alps (and we climbed Mont Blanc!)  Now it's time to get back to work.  This week I'm visiting a few Java User Groups to talk about the usual topics: Adobe AIR and Flex![](http://www.jamesward.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/mont_blanc_summit.jpg)

Here is the schedule:
July 7 - [Zurich Java User Group](http://www.jugs.ch/html/events/2008/ria_flex.html)

Also on July 11 I will be at the [Adobe RedMonk SAP Enterprisey Nanoconference](http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2008/06/23/adobe-redmonk-sap-enterprisey-nanoconference-london-july-11th/) with James Governor of RedMonk.
