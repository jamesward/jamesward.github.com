Last year at JavaPolis [Bruce Eckel](http://mindviewinc.com), [Christoph
Rooms](http://christophrooms.com/), and I did a keynote about Flex. That talk
has been posted on [Parleys.com](http://www.parleys.com/) (which btw is an
awesome Flex app!). You can watch it there, in their Adobe AIR application, or
right here using the new Parleys.com Share (beta) widget. If you have any
problems watching it here please let me know or [file a
bug](http://jira.parleys.com/browse/SHARE). Thanks!
