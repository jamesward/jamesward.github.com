Last year at JavaPolis [Bruce Eckel](http://mindviewinc.com), [Christoph Rooms](http://christophrooms.com/), and I did a keynote about Flex.  That talk has been posted on [Parleys.com](http://www.parleys.com/) (which btw is an awesome Flex app!).  You can watch it there, in their Adobe AIR application, or right here using the new Parleys.com Share (beta) widget.  If you have any problems watching it here please let me know or [file a bug](http://jira.parleys.com/browse/SHARE).  Thanks!
