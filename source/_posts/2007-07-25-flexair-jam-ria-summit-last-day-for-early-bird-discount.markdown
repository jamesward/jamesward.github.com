Today is the last day you will be able to get the early bird discount on the
[Flex/AIR Jam](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/FlexAIRJam/Index.php)
and [RIA Summit](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/RIA/Index.php)
conferences in Crested Butte. Also, attendees of the Flex/AIR Jam will get a
free copy of Flex Builder! The Jam will be a fantastic way to learn how to use
or extend your knowledge of Flex and AIR. Bring your laptop and spend two days
of hands-on, coached coding. The RIA Summit will be a three day [Open
Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_meeting) style event focused on
discussion about Rich Internet Applications. I've been to events run by Bruce
Eckel in Crested Butte before. They are the best events I've been to and
highly recommend them. Go sign up today to get the early bird discount. I hope
to see you there!
