We've just posted [episode 2](http://www.drunkonsoftware.com/2008/10/30/episode-2-flex-automated-testing-and-flexmonkey/) of the new "[Drunk on Software](http://www.drunkonsoftware.com)" video podcast.  In this episode [Jon Rose](http://www.ectropic.com) and I talk with Stu Stern from [Gorilla Logic](http://www.gorillalogic.com/) about automated testing and [FlexMonkey](http://code.google.com/p/flexmonkey/) - a tool for automating unit tests in Flex.  Let us know what you think.
