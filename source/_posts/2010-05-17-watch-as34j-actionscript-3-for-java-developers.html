Last week I did an eSeminar on <a href="http://seminars.adobe.acrobat.com/p69179960/">AS34J - ActionScript 3 for Java Developers</a>.  This was originally a presentation that <a href="http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/">Chet Haase</a> and I did at <a href="http://www.devoxx.com">Devoxx</a>.  Later Chet also published the presentation as a two part article on JavaWorld (<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2009/jw-02-actionscript1.html">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-2009/jw-03-actionscript2.html">Part 2</a>).  Check out the <a href="http://seminars.adobe.acrobat.com/p69179960/">eSeminar</a> and let me know what you think.
