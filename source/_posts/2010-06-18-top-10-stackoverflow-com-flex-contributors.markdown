Back in the day the [FlexCoders Yahoo!
Group](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/flexcoders/) was all the rage. It
was the place where Flex rock stars like [Alex
Harui](http://blogs.adobe.com/aharui/) and [Doug
McCune](http://dougmccune.com/blog/) hung out and helped the community learn
Flex. But these days a lot of developers have turned to
[StackOverflow.com](http://www.stackoverflow.com) as their primary resource
for getting answers to their technical questions. I started using Stack
Overflow over a year ago primarily because it makes it easy to follow the
conversation around a specific question and quickly identify the right answer.
Stack Overflow totally nails what I need as a developer when I have problems
and questions. Many Flex rock stars have stepped up and frequently answered
questions on Stack Overflow and I wanted to highlight the top 10 contributors
to [the "Flex" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=flex&so
rt=newest&pagesize=50).

As of June 18, 2010 the top 10 Flex contributors on Stack Overflow ([based on
"All Time" total score](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=fle
x&sort=stats&pagesize=50)) are:
