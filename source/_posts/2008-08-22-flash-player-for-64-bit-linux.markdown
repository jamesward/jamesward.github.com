It appears the Flash Player engineering team is [making progress on 64-bit
Linux support](http://thebackbutton.com/blog/73/64-bit-linux-freebsd-flash-
player-exists/). There are no details yet on when this will ship. But I'm sure
[they could still use your help](http://www.jamesward.com/wordpress/2008/05/16
/where-is-64-bit-linux-support-for-flash-player/).
