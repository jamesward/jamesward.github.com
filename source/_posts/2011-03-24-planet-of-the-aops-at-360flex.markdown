This year at [360|Flex](http://www.360flex.com/) in Denver I'll be co-presenting a session with [Mike Labriola](http://www.digitalprimates.net/author/codeslinger/) called "[Planet of the AOPs](http://www.360flex.com/schedule/)".  What is the Planet of the AOPs?  Let me give you a little hint...

    
    public class Foo {
      private function getPrivateBar():String {
        return "private bar";
      }
    }




    
    var foo:Foo = new Foo();
    foo['getPrivateBar']();



Yup!  It's gonna be fun!  The session will be on Tuesday April 12th at 2:50pm.  Hope to see you there!

Also, Mike and I are doing a [360|Flex speaker chat](http://www.360flex.com/blog/2011/03/360flex-2011-speaker-chat-michael-labriola/) today at 11am (MDT).
