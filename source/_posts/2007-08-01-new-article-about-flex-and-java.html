My friend <a href="http://ectropic.com/wordpress/">Jon Rose</a> has written a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/java_flex.html">great article</a> on using Flex and Java together.  Jon is a long time Java programmer.  We were coding Java web apps together back in the days before Struts.  It's great to see Jon making statements like "Flex is the most obvious and elegant solution currently available to Java developers."  The article also references some of my code from the <a href="/wordpress/2007/04/30/ajax-and-flex-data-loading-benchmarks/">Census App</a> to show how easy it is to integrate Java & Flex.  If you are a Java programmer you should definitely read this article.
