On February 15, 2011 I'll be presenting at the Detroit Java User Group about [Building Cross-Device Apps with Flex and Spring](http://detroitjugfebruary2011-estw.eventbrite.com/).  If you live in the Detroit area then I hope to see you there!  If not, then talk to your local Java User Group leader about having me come and speak.

Here is the abstract for the talk:
Today, users want apps in the browser, on their desktop, phone, tablet, and TV.  Reusing code across all of these devices is now crucial for developers.  By combining Flex for the UI with Spring and Hibernate for the back-end, developers can build apps that work on a variety of devices including PCs, Android phones / tablets, the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, iPhones, and iPads.  This session will walk developers through the steps for creating these cross-device apps with Flex and Java.
