I'm here at day one of Dreamforce 2008, Salesforce.com's annual conference.  During Marc Benioff's keynote they announced the new <a href="http://developer.force.com/sites">Force.com Sites</a> technology for Salesforce hosted websites which can integrate with Salesforce data.  At the end of the keynote Marc brought out Neil Young to talk about <a href="http://lincvolt.force.com">LincVolt</a>, an open community for converting gasoline based cars to electric / compressed natural gas cars.  It's a very cool project but what I was really excited about was their use of Flex on the <a href="http://lincvolt.force.com">Force.com Sites powered LincVolt website</a>.  Here is a camera phone picture of the keynote (notice the sexy Flex chart at the bottom - which you can also see by going to the site).

Very cool stuff!

Walking around the expo floor I'm seeing a ton of Flex.  I'm trying to get it all on video.  So keep watching here for more details on what people are doing with Salesforce and Flex.
