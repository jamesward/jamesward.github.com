As expected...  [Devoxx 2011](http://devoxx.com/display/DV11/Home) rocked!  Such a fun conference with top notch sessions and people.  I presented a session on how to deploy Java, Play Framework, and Scala apps on Heroku.  [Matt Raible](http://raibledesigns.com) did a great (and very thorough) [write-up on my session](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/deploying_java_and_play_framework).  Thanks Matt!  Here are my slides:


There was also some hot news at Devoxx...  [Play Framework 2](http://www.playframework.org/2.0) is the official web framework in the [Typesafe Stack](http://typesafe.com/technology/play)!  And [Heroku already supports Play 2](https://github.com/playframework/Play20/wiki/ProductionHeroku)!  Awesome stuff.
