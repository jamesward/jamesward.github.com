Almost a year ago I began working with Ron Hess and Dave Carroll from
Salesforce on the Flex Toolkit for Apex - a port of the JavaScript libraries
for Salesforce.com's web services. Since that time the toolkit has matured and
been used in numerous production applications. Today I am pleased to announce
the new Force.com Toolkit for Adobe AIR and Flex. This new toolkit build on
the Flex Toolkit for Apex and adds additional functionality for the new Adobe
AIR runtime for desktop RIAs.

For more information on the new toolkit check out [a tutorial I
wrote](https://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/AIR_and_Flex_Toolkit) on how to
use it. Also visit [the new Salesforce page on the Adobe Developer
Connection](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/salesforce/).

It was very impressive seeing all of the amazing applications that were built
with the original toolkit. I can't wait to see what you build with this new
toolkit. Let us know how it goes!
