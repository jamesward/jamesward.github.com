A few months ago I met with Salesforce.com about Flex and Apollo.  They had begun building some Flex applications that used the Flex Ajax Bridge to communicate with Salesforce.  This worked but they wanted to be able to more easily build Flex and Apollo applications.  So I took their JavaScript library and did an initial port to ActionScript.  Surprisingly the code ported pretty easily.  It was actually a fascinating experiment.  ActionScript 3 is based on the same specification as JavaScript 2, so in theory this kind of thing should be pretty trivial -- especially if the code being ported doesn't do much with the browser DOM.  That was the situation in this case because the Salesforce JavaScript library talks to their backend via XHR and doesn't do much with the browser DOM.  Once I had an initial port done including authentication and query support Ron and Dave from Salesforce.com cleaned everything up, added better object typing, built complex examples, and developed an Apollo demo.  Everything has been going on under a semi-secret SourceForge project, code named Mavericks.

"Adobe Flex Toolkit for Apex" is the formal name for this new Flex / Apollo library.  The library is licensed under BSD so everyone can easily reuse it in their applications.  Because it uses a simple asynchronous communications model and typed objects wherever possible, this new library accelerates the process of building Flex and Apollo applications on top of the Salesforce.com Apex platform.  With just a few lines of code you can get data from Salesforce.com and render it in your application.  There are three primary ways to use this toolkit.  You can use it to build Apollo based desktop applications, create custom web applications hosted on your site, or build a custom S-Control hosted on Salesforce.com.  For instructions on how to build a custom S-Control and the basics of using the toolkit, check out the <a href="http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Tutorial:_Creating_Flex_Salesforce_Mashups">Creating Flex Salesforce Mashups</a> tutorial.

Here is what you need to do to build an Apollo application using the Flex Toolkit for Apex.

1.	Download the toolkit:
<a href="http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Members:Flex_Toolkit_download">http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Members:Flex_Toolkit_download</a>

2.	If you haven't already done so, install Flex Builder and the Apollo Extensions:
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/tryflex">http://www.adobe.com/go/tryflex</a>
<a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/apollo/">http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/apollo/</a>

3.	Create a new Apollo Project

4.	Add the Salesforce SWC to the Library Build Path
<img src='http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/salesforce2.png' alt='salesforce2.png' />

5.	Write your Apollo application:
<div width="100%" style="background: #cccccc; overflow: auto; padding: 6px;">
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;mx:ApolloApplication xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" xmlns:salesforce="http://www.salesforce.com/"
  creationComplete="conn.loginWithCredentials('dev@mavericks.demo', '123456', new AsyncResponder(loginResult, loginFault));"&gt;

  &lt;mx:Script&gt;
  &lt;![CDATA[
  import mx.controls.Alert;
  import com.salesforce.results.QueryResult;
  import com.salesforce.AsyncResponder;
  
  private function loginResult(result:Object):void
  {
    conn.query("SELECT Id, Contact.Firstname, Contact.Lastname FROM Contact",
      new AsyncResponder(queryResult));
  }
  
  private function loginFault(fault:Object):void
  {
    Alert.show("Login error!");
  }
  
  private function queryResult(qr:QueryResult):void
  {
    dg.dataProvider = qr.records;
  }
      
  ]]&gt;
  &lt;/mx:Script&gt;

  &lt;salesforce:Connection id="conn"/&gt;
  
  &lt;mx:DataGrid id="dg" width="100%" height="100%"/&gt;
  
&lt;/mx:ApolloApplication&gt;</pre>
</div>

6.	Save it (which automatically compiles it)

7.	Run it
<img src='http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/salesforce3.png' alt='salesforce3.png' />

8.	Export it as an installable AIR file so you can share it with others

9.	Say “WOW!”

It really is that easy.  To learn more check out the examples in the toolkit.  Also if you really want to dive in, the toolkit is 100% Open Source so you can look at all the code and even help us improve it.  Check it out from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sforce">SourceForge SVN repository</a>.  I'm working on another article which will walk you through setting up the environment to begin hacking on the toolkit using either the Free Flex SDK or Flex Builder (we support both methods).  I hope you find the toolkit useful and please let me know what cool things you build with it!
