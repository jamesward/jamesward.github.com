My buddy [Chet Haase](http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/) has written an excellent book on Flex 4, called "[Flex 4 Fun](http://booksites.artima.com/flex_4_fun)".  Chet's humor, insight, and concise examples make this a "fun" way to learn Flex.  Artima.com has posted some excerpts from the book to give you an idea of what to expect.
