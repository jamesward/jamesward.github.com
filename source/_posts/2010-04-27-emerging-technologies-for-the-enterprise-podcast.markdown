While I was at the Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise
[conference](http://phillyemergingtech.com/) in Philly I was able to
participate in a [very fun
podcast](http://chariottechcast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=605733). The
casual chat was hosted by [Ken Rimple](http://www.rimple.com/tech) of [Chariot
Solutions](http://chariotsolutions.com/). Participating in the podcast were
[Adam Coomes](http://www.twitter.com/adamcoomes) of Infegy, [Ed
Burns](http://www.twitter.com/edburns) of Oracle,
[Cote](http://twitter.com/cote) of Redmonk, and myself. Topics ranged from
cheesesteaks to turbo buttons. Give [it a
listen](http://chariottechcast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=605733) and let me
know what you think!
