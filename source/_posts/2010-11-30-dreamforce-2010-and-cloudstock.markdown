I'll be speaking at [Dreamforce](http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF10/home/) again this year!  I have two sessions that are going to be super fun!  First is a panel called "Cloud Mobility: Taking Critical Business Functions With You, Whenever, Wherever" on Wednesday at 3:15 PM.  Then on Thursday at 11am I'll be co-presenting a session on "Building Rich User Interfaces with Adobe Flash Builder for Force.com" with Markus Spohn from Salesforce.com.

Preceding Dreamforce is the [Cloudstock](http://www.cloudstockevent.com) event where you can see some other great presentations related to Flex and RIAs.  [Lee Brimelow](http://blog.theflashblog.com/) will be doing a presentation on "Flex and Flash Platform on the Cloud" that is guaranteed to entertain and educate.  There will also be presentations from Nigel Pegg on Real-time Apps and Keith Sutton on "Adobeâ€™s Cloud Offerings for Developers and Enterprises".

It's going to be a great week!  I hope to see you at Dreamforce 2010!
