The Flash Platform (Adobe AIR, Flash Player, Flex, etc.) has become a mainstream software development platform.  This is very exciting but also leads to me getting a boat-load of email.  That is great!  I love hearing from the community and answering questions.  I do respond to every email I get - even if it takes a year!  I am frequently asked about partnerships.  It seems that everyone who is building products or services related to the Flash Platform wants to know how they can help Adobe and how Adobe can help them.  I love getting these emails because as the ecosystem around the Flash Platform grows, the Platform itself grows.  But due to my often high latency in responding to email I figured it would be good to document many of the Flash Platform Partner resources that are already out there.  Here they are...
