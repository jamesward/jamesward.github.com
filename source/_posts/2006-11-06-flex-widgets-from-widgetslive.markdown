This morning I had the opportunity to present at the [WidgetsLive! Conference](http://www.widgetslive.com) about Flex and widgets.  I showed a few examples using [Ely Greenfield's DisplayShelf component](http://www.quietlyscheming.com/blog/2006/11/01/using-the-graphics-api-for-richer-flex-the-displayshelf-component-from-my-max-talk/).  One example pulled in images from Flickr.  Check out the [demo](http://www.jamesward.org/flickrWidget/flickrWidget.html) and the [code](http://www.jamesward.org/flickrWidget/srcview/index.html).  I also was thinking it would be cool to throw some YouTube videos into the DisplayShelf component.  After a few minutes I was able to make it work with the exception that I couldn't get the reflection to not flicker during video playback.  I'll need to get help from Ely to fix that, so for now I've disabled the real-time reflector.  You can see the [demo](http://www.jamesward.org/youtubeWidget/youtubeWidget.html) of the YouTube DisplayShelf widget and get the [code](http://www.jamesward.org/youtubeWidget/srcview/index.html).  I also quickly turned one of the Display Shelf apps into an desktop widget using [Apollo](http://www.adobe.com/go/apollo).  I hope all the attendees enjoyed the session and for those who weren't there, enjoy the demos!
