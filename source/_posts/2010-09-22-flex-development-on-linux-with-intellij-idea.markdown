It's kinda hard to believe that I've been doing Flex development on Linux for over six years now.  In that time I've tried a few different tools.  Vim will always be my favorite but debugging is painful.  [Flex Builder for Linux](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/flexbuilder_linux/) worked but lacked major features and commitment from Adobe for continual improvement.  Most recently I've been using [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for Flex development on Linux.  It's been working great!  There are a few things I've had to get used to but they are doing a great job of providing superb tooling support for Flex.  I've also been very impressed with the responsiveness from the IntelliJ team in their [forums](http://devnet.jetbrains.net/community/idea/ideacommunity?view=discussions) and [bug system](http://youtrack.jetbrains.net/dashboard/IDEA#tab=0).

Here is a quick video I recorded to show the basics of using IntelliJ IDEA for Flex development on Linux:


To get started download either the [latest prerelease of IntelliJ IDEA](http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/IDEADEV/IDEA+X+EAP) or their [current production version](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html).  Flex development is only available in their Ultimate Edition but they do provide a free 30 day trial.  Let me know what you think.
