Edit: Whoops. It's on the 14th not the 24th!

Intuit's Cloud / Platform as a Service (PaaS) technology called the Intuit
Partner Platform (IPP) has quickly matured into a first class Client + Cloud
solution. Building a custom user interface with IPP is done through Flex. This
is a perfect combination and opens many opportunities for developers to build
and sell apps into Intuit's extensive ecosystem. They are doing a [Webinar on
January 14](https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/152420656) about what's new
in IPP v2.4. This is a great opportunity to learn more about how you can build
apps for the IPP with Flex. Definitely a session not to miss!
