Since I'm frequently at conferences meeting cool people I thought it would be fun to start recording videos of some of the great things I get to see in my travels.  For lack of a more creative title I'm just calling these "RIA Cowboy Videos".  This first video is from AjaxWorld 2008 where I had the guys from <a href="http://www.neotys.com/">Neotys</a> talk about and show off their product <a href="http://www.neotys.com/load-testing-tool/Overview.html?from=mid">NeoLoad</a>, that load tests Flex applications.  Interestingly I just watched a <a href="http://myflex.org//demos/JettyBlazeDS/JettyBlazeDSloadTest.html">screencast</a> by the <a href="http://www.faratasystems.com/">Farata Systems</a> guys where they used NeoLoad to load test BlazeDS on Jetty using the new Servlet 3 NIO stuff.  Detailed article <a href="http://flex.sys-con.com/node/720304">here</a>.

Here's the video.  Let me know what you think!

BTW: I'm a total video novice so the quality of these videos will hopefully improve over time.  I've already purchased a new Bluetooth mic, which should improve the sound quality in future videos.
