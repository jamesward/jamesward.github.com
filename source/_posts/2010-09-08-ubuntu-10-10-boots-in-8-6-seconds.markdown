*** Update: My boot time is now down to 7 seconds! New video coming soon. ***  
I just updated to the latest Ubuntu 10.10 desktop and noticed that boot time
is now extremely fast! My Intel Core 2 Duo 2.80GHz laptop with an Intel SSD
now boots in 8.6 seconds! That is from boot loader all the way to logged in
and ready to use! Nice work Ubuntu! Check out the video if you want to see it
in action:

Ubuntu 10.10 will be released in October, 2010 but if you want to check it out
now, [get the beta](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/maverick/beta).
