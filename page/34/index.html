  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just noticed that the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/search?query=flexcoders">flexcoders Yahoo! Group</a> now has over 5000 members!  That&#8217;s pretty amazing!  This list was founded almost 3 years ago on March 17, 2004.  But my <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/flexcoders/message/8291">first post</a> wasn&#8217;t until January 17, 2005.  So I am but a newbie.  Congrats to all those early founders who started the revolution and have continued answering questions for years and years.  A special shout-out to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mdowney/212801231/">Matt Chotin</a> who has posted 3407 messages!  Wow!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve heard it so many times&#8230;  &#8220;Flash 9 doesn&#8217;t work on 64bit Linux&#8221;  So when I loaded 64bit Gentoo Linux my new Merom based Intel Core 2 Duo, I really was expecting an adventure.  Turns out that it was actually pretty uneventful.  It worked first try without any problems and in only 2 commands.  Here&#8217;s what I did..</p>

<p>First I added the net-www/netscape-flash package to /etc/portage/package.unmask
<code>sudo vi /etc/portage/package.unmask</code></p>

<p>Then I emerged Flash 9 &amp; the Netscape Plugin Wrapper
<code>sudo emerge -av netscape-flash nspluginwrapper</code></p>

<p>Then I reloaded Firefox, tested it, and it works great!  I assume it&#8217;s this easy on other distributions, but I only have Gentoo to test on.</p>

<p>Of course this means much more than just being able to watch YouTube videos&#8230;  Now that the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/sdk/">Flex 2 SDK is free</a> (as in beer) anyone can build applications that work the same on all major browsers and operating systems!  I&#8217;m happy to say that since I started doing Flex development about two years ago, Firefox on Linux has been my primary build and test environment.  And in that two years the only time I&#8217;ve had to write any of those &#8220;if IE&#8221; things was when I was writing JavaScript for a soon to be released Ajax &amp; Flex benchmarking tool.</p>

<p>Using my OS of choice&#8230;  Writing code once that works the same universally&#8230; These are things that make me happy.  :)</p>

<p>Oh, and the fact that Flash is now built on the Mozilla / Open Source <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/">Tamarin VM</a> makes me ecstatic!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Currently the latest version of Flash 9 for Windows &amp; Mac is 9.0.28.0 and for Linux (currently in beta) it&#8217;s 9.0.21.78.  Notice that that third digit is different?  That&#8217;s mostly because Flash 9 for Linux doesn&#8217;t yet support full screen.  Unless your application is unusable without full screen, then please be nice to us folks on Linux and don&#8217;t tell your Flash detection script to require 9.0.28.  This is an easy mistake to make.  Even we (Adobe) recently did this with the <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/">Kuler app</a>.  Which currently doesn&#8217;t work on Linux due to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/messageview.cfm?forumid=72&amp;catid=622&amp;threadid=1217042&amp;enterthread=y">an evil 28 in the detection script</a>.  If you really do need 9.0.28, then the right thing to do would be to tell your detection script to require it for Windows &amp; Mac, and just require 9.0.0 for Linux.  Otherwise we end up having to write GreaseMonkey scripts to de-28 offending pages.  And nobody wants to join the list of sites which need de-28 grease.</p>

<p><strong><em> Update </em></strong>
Good news!  The Kuler team has updated their site to now work on Linux!  Now this is the beauty of the Flash Platform!  True write once, run anywhere applications!  And you don&#8217;t even need any &#8220;if IE&#8221; hacks!  And you can even get away with only testing on one browser and one OS (provided you mind the gap).  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Flex 2 added a neat little feature which allows you to load Runtime Shared Libraries, from other domains.  And since the browser caches these libraries in theory we could all point to a central set of Flex 2 Framework RSLs and users of your application would only have to download the RSLs the first time they went to an application which used them.  Before I show you how to make this work, lets talk about the caveats&#8230;  First and most important, THIS IS UNSUPPORTED BY ADOBE.  While the Flex team is working on a better, more permanent solution to this problem, this is really a hack and despite the fact that I am using this in my applications, neither I or Adobe warranty or support the use of this in any way.  Second, since there is no failover mechanism, until we find a better home for the RSLs, if you choose to point to my hosted RSLs, your application will be at the mercy of my web server.  Third, if someone hacks my web server and uploads new cracked malware RSLs, or uses a man-in-the-middle attack to replace the RSLs in flight, then you (and I) have been <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=p0wned">p0wned</a>.  Fourth, I, James Ward, may have included modified Flex framework files which do bad things, like track user behavior/input and report them back to my server.  While I promise I have not done this, if you choose to use these RSLs, you are putting your trust in my promise.</p>

<p>So despite the caveats, I still think this hack is sufficient enough for many applications.  Flex engineering is really working hard to make this work for everyone.  In the mean time what is outlined here may likely help you to dramatically reduce SWF size.  Read on to find out how.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Start</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve created 3 RSLs, a small one, with just the dependencies of mx.core.Application and a medium one with what I guessed were the 20 or so most commonly used components, and then a large one with over 30 other components.  Each RSL does not include the contents of the smaller RSLs.  So if you want to take advantage of this technique using the medium RSL, then you will need to use the medium AND the small RSL.  Here is table with the information about the RSLs:</p>

<p>RSLSizeSWCLinker SourceSWC Catalog</p>

<p>[small</p>

<p>106K</p>

<p><a href="http://ws.jamesward.org/framework-2_0_1_b-small.swc">Download SWC</a></p>

<p><a href="http://flexapps.cvs.sourceforge.net/flexapps/hosted_rsls/src/smallLinker.as?view=log">smallLinker.as</a></p>

<p><a href="http://ws.jamesward.org/framework-2_0_1_b-small.xml">Catalog XML</a></p>

<p>[medium</p>

<p>160K</p>

<p><a href="http://ws.jamesward.org/framework-2_0_1_b-medium.swc">Download SWC</a></p>

<p><a href="http://flexapps.cvs.sourceforge.net/flexapps/hosted_rsls/src/mediumLinker.as?view=log">mediumLinker.as</a></p>

<p><a href="http://ws.jamesward.org/framework-2_0_1_b-medium.xml">Catalog XML</a></p>

<p>[large</p>

<p>141K</p>

<p><a href="http://ws.jamesward.org/framework-2_0_1_b-large.swc">Download SWC</a></p>

<p><a href="http://flexapps.cvs.sourceforge.net/flexapps/hosted_rsls/src/largeLinker.as?view=log">largeLinker.as</a></p>

<p><a href="http://ws.jamesward.org/framework-2_0_1_b-large.xml">Catalog XML</a></p>

<p>Once you have decided which RSL to use, follow these instructions:
1) Download the SWC for the RSL(s) you want to use from <a href="http://ws.jamesward.org">ws.jamesward.org</a>
2) Fix your build path
2.1) If you are compiling via Ant or the command line, then specify your external-library-path and runtime-shared-libraries like:</p>

<p><code>flex2-sdk/bin/mxmlc \
  -external-library-path+=build/framework-2_0_1_b-small.swc,build/framework-2_0_1_b-medium.swc  \
  -runtime-shared-libraries=http://ws.jamesward.org/framework-2_0_1_b-small.swf,http://ws.jamesward.org/framework-2_0_1_b-medium.swf\
  -o=build/testHostedFlexLibs-medium.swf \
  -file-specs=test/testHostedFlexLibs.mxml
</code></p>

<p>2.2) If you are using Flex Builder then go to Project -> Properties -> Flex Build Path -> Library Path -> Add SWC -> [Enter or browse to the first SWC] -> Add all the SWCs you will be using.  Then select a SWC&#8217;s RSL URL and select the Edit button.  Change the Link Type to &#8220;Runtime shard library (RSL)&#8221;, set the RSL URL to the correct swf url on ws.jamesward.org, deselect the &#8220;Auto extract checkbox&#8221;, and then select the OK button.  Repeat this for each SWC.  When done, select the OK button to exit the Project Properties.  Here is what my Build Path looks like:
<img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/buildpath.png" alt="Build Path" /></p>

<p>2.3) If you are using FDS, then just add the SWC(s) to your flex/user_classes dir and update the runtime-shared-libraries accordingly in the flex-config.xml file.</p>

<p>3) Recompile your Flex app (if Flex Builder didn&#8217;t do this for you automatically) and the file size should be significantly lower!</p>

<p>4) One more caveat&#8230;  You have to actually load your application from a web server for it to work.  This is due to the Flash local OR network sandbox.  Maybe someone can suggest a better workaround.</p>

<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>

<p>This all starts with the Preloader.  The out of the box preloader doesn&#8217;t support cross domain loaded RSLs.  If you use my hosted RSL(s) then you don&#8217;t need to worry about this since it includes the patched Preloader.  However, if you are interested in really knowing how this all works, or if you want to download the source code and play with it, then here is what you need to do.  In order for your application to be able to use the classes in the crossdomain loaded RSL, the Preloader needs to specify the securityDomain for the loaderContext of the RSLs.  So in the loadRSL function of my patched mx/preloaders/Preloader.as file I have:</p>

<p><code>loaderContext.securityDomain = SecurityDomain.currentDomain;
loaderContext.applicationDomain = ApplicationDomain.currentDomain;
</code></p>

<p>The source code I use to build the RSLs is available on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexapps">Source Forge</a>.  If you want to play with the code, then you will need to copy the Preloader.as from the Flex SDK&#8217;s source code, update the RSL loaderContext as noted above, and add the import for the flash.system.SecurityDomain class.</p>

<p>You can also see that I have a <a href="http://ws.jamesward.org/crossdomain.xml">wildcard crossdomain.xml</a> policy file on ws.jamesward.org which allows Flash player to load the RSLs no matter what domain the requesting application is hosted on.  One quick note on crossdomain policy files, since I don&#8217;t think it is said clearly enough, and often enough&#8230;
DO NOT EVER PUT A WILDCARD CROSSDOMAIN POLICY FILE ON A DOMAIN IF EITHER OF THE FOLLOWING APPLY:
 - THE DOMAIN IS USED FOR COOKIE BASED OR BASIC AUTHENTICATION
 - THE DOMAIN IS ON AN INTERNAL NETWORK</p>

<p>Now about the small, medium, and large RSLs&#8230;  For now I opted to use just three RSLs to keep it simple.  I am using just simple linker classes and compc to create the SWCs, then expanding the SWCs to get the SWF, which is the RSL.  You can see all this in the source code, specifically, the <a href="http://flexapps.cvs.sourceforge.net/flexapps/hosted_rsls/build.sh?view=log">build.sh</a> file.  I have also guessed at the best way to organize the RSLs (as far as what classes go where), but definitely want to hear what others think.</p>

<p>Now the fun part&#8230;  To prove this all works, first go to the <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/testHostedFlexLibs-large-1.swf">test app</a> on www.jamesward.org and watch as the RSLs are loaded from ws.jamesward.org.  You should now have all 3 RSLs in your browser cache and if you now go to another <a href="http://www.thebetterside.com/testHostedFlexLibs-large-1.swf">test app</a> on a different domain the application should load much faster since it only needs to load 72K instead of what would have been over 400K (my test app doesn&#8217;t use all the classes in the three RSLs).</p>

<p><strong>The Future?</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;d really like to hear feedback if this is a viable hack for those looking to reduce Flex app size.  Let me know if you plan to use this technique, or if you don&#8217;t, why?  What should be different?  Also, I think someone could further hack the preloader to support failover and md5 checksums.  Any takers?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your feedback!</p>

<p>Many times I am asked &#8220;Where do I start learning about Flex?&#8221;.  Most of the time I point them to <a href="http://flex.org">flex.org</a> as a starting point.  However it is often just easier to see the product in action.  So I recorded a screencast of me building a simple Flex app with Flex Builder.  Here it is:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/media/flexapp/">http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/media/flexapp/</a></p>

<p>I hope this is helpful to those of you new to Flex.  After you watch the screencast, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/openflextrial">download Flex Builder</a> and give it a try.  If you find yourself saying things like &#8220;Wow!  Coding is fun again!&#8221; or &#8220;I had no idea RIA programming was so easy!&#8221;, Welcome to Flexland!  A few years ago I found myself in Flexland and to me it&#8217;s like being in the mountains&#8230;  Once you are there, you never want to be anywhere else.  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I had the opportunity to present at the <a href="http://www.widgetslive.com">WidgetsLive! Conference</a> about Flex and widgets.  I showed a few examples using <a href="http://www.quietlyscheming.com/blog/2006/11/01/using-the-graphics-api-for-richer-flex-the-displayshelf-component-from-my-max-talk/">Ely Greenfield&#8217;s DisplayShelf component</a>.  One example pulled in images from Flickr.  Check out the <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/flickrWidget/flickrWidget.html">demo</a> and the <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/flickrWidget/srcview/index.html">code</a>.  I also was thinking it would be cool to throw some YouTube videos into the DisplayShelf component.  After a few minutes I was able to make it work with the exception that I couldn&#8217;t get the reflection to not flicker during video playback.  I&#8217;ll need to get help from Ely to fix that, so for now I&#8217;ve disabled the real-time reflector.  You can see the <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/youtubeWidget/youtubeWidget.html">demo</a> of the YouTube DisplayShelf widget and get the <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/youtubeWidget/srcview/index.html">code</a>.  I also quickly turned one of the Display Shelf apps into an desktop widget using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/apollo">Apollo</a>.  I hope all the attendees enjoyed the session and for those who weren&#8217;t there, enjoy the demos!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week while many of us were gallivanting around Vegas at MAX, Oracle was holding their OpenWorld conference in San Francicso.  Unfortunately I wasn&#8217;t able to be in two places at once, so I didn&#8217;t attend OpenWorld.  But I did have the opportunity of building a Flex demo for one of the Oracle keynotes.  I really just took a few of our sample applications and portalized them.  You can see the end result on <a href="http://portalstandards.oracle.com/portal/page/portal/FlexPG/Flex%20Demo%201/Tab">Oracle&#8217;s Portlet Testing Site</a>.  One cool thing to point out is that the portlets are actually remote portlets being served via Oracle&#8217;s JPDK.  In case you want to play around with these portlets in your own portal, the provider url is: <a href="http://www.jamesward.org:8888/flexportlets/providers/flex_portlets">http://www.jamesward.org:8888/flexportlets/providers/flex_portlets</a></p>

<p>Also be sure to read the Oracle Press Release:
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2006_oct/openworldsf06-06.html">Oracle and Adobe Collaborate to Enable Enterprise Rich Client Development</a></p>

<p>And an article I helped write: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/flexportalintegration">Providing Rich Portlets with Adobe Flex</a></p>

<p>In the past 2 months Flex was used in a keynote at Intel&#8217;s developer conference, a Flex application took second place at SAP TechED&#8217;s Demo Jam, and most recently Oracle did the keynote Flex demo at OpenWorld!  Enterprise software continues to be transformed by Flex!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As of yesterday, for the first time EVER, nearly everyone in the world has access to a <strong>FREE</strong>, <strong>ubiquitous</strong> application runtime, and a <strong>FREE</strong> application development toolkit for that runtime!  Of course I&#8217;m referring to <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html">Flash Player 9</a> and the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_2_for_Linux">free Flex 2 SDK</a>.  To show people the power of these two technologies I&#8217;ve recorded a screen cam of me building a YouTube video player on Linux.  Check it out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>UPDATE: I recommend using the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/tourdeflex/web/#docIndex=0;illustIndex=0;sampleId=70030">AdvancedDataGrid</a> control in Flex 3 and Flex 4.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to Latha for updating my old Flex 1.5 TreeGrid code to Flex 2:

<p>Check out a demo of Latha&#8217;s work:</p>

<p>Looks like I&#8217;m off the hook!  :)  Thanks Latha!</p>
