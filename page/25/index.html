  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/tux_w_fx_flag_blog.png" alt="" />Revolutions may be enabled by technology, but they are driven by people.  Adobe’s recent announcements about Flex, Flash, and Adobe AIR on Linux are the most recent technology enablers for the software revolution that is currently underway.</p>

<p>Usually I&#8217;m one of the first to post about Adobe&#8217;s Linux related announcements.  My trip to Bangalore, India, however, made me a little late to the party this time.  In case you haven&#8217;t seen <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200803/033108AdobeAIRforLinux.html">the announcements</a>, on March 31, 2008 Adobe released an alpha version of Adobe AIR on Linux and an update to the alpha version of Flex Builder 3 for Linux (which supports building AIR applications on Linux). On the same day Adobe also announced that we joined the Linux Foundation.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/jd/archives/2008/03/what_airlinux_m.cfm">a post about the announcement</a>, JD points to <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2006/10/19/flash-flex-free-for-all-even-linux/">one of my old blog posts</a>, which still accurately echoes the significance of this announcement - &#8220;&#8230; for the first time EVER, nearly everyone in the world has access to a FREE, ubiquitous application runtime, and a FREE application development toolkit for that runtime! Of course I&#8217;m referring to Flash Player 9 and the free Flex 2 SDK.&#8221;  Now I can update this statement &#8220;For the first time EVER, everyone in the world has access to a FREE, ubiquitous web runtime, a FREE cross-OS desktop runtime, and a FREE, open source, and mature development toolkit for those runtimes!  Of course I&#8217;m referring to Flash Player 9, Adobe AIR, and the Flex 3 SDK.&#8221;  This is huge.  We can now build real software once and have it run on every major OS and in every major browser – and we can do it using open source tools!</p>

<p>Why the excitement?  Haven&#8217;t we had this for years - with Java? QT? GTK?  True&#8230; in theory.  We&#8217;ve had the technology; but we always lacked a critical mass of people that were actually using it for wide reaching, real software.  There are now countless companies - including Oracle, SAP, Salesforce.com, Intuit, E*Trade, eBay, AOL, NASDAQ, Yahoo!, and numerous startups – that are using Flex to build real software for Flash Player on the web and Adobe AIR on the desktop.  This kind of software revolution is reminiscent of the transition from client-server to web applications.  The movement is real.  The technology is mature (even the new Adobe AIR desktop runtime consists primarily of mature, proven technologies like Flash Player, Tamarin, SQLite, and Webkit).  Software is changing for the better, especially for those of us on Linux.</p>

<p>I now have several desktop applications installed on Linux - such as the eBay Desktop - which I would never have had before AIR worked on Linux.  Most companies simply do not invest time and money building or porting their software for such a small customer base.  With AIR it doesn&#8217;t matter.  Companies build the software once and it works on the web, on the desktop, on Windows, on Mac, on Linux.  This is a software revolution not because the technology exists, but because people - lots of people - are actually using it.</p>

<p>Today we call the products of this software revolution &#8220;Rich Internet Applications&#8221;.  In ten years it&#8217;ll just be &#8220;software&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is always fun when you discover new product features that you never knew existed.  This happened to me last week as I was looking into Flex 3 skinning.  It turns out that not only can you use a single class with states to define component skin states (like &#8220;up&#8221;, &#8220;down&#8221;, and &#8220;over&#8221; on a Button) but transitions also work with these skins!  This feature has been noticed by <a href="http://www.asfusion.com/blog/entry/stateful-skins-in-flex-3e-color-transitions-in-buttons-now-possible">others</a> as well.  But I figured I&#8217;d blog about it anyways - because it&#8217;s so cool!</p>

<p>Here is a quick demo:</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.darronschall.com/weblog/archives/000254.cfm">Darron Schall&#8217;s &#8220;AnimateColor&#8221; effect</a> to transition between colors.  And I used <a href="http://degrafa.com/">Degrafa</a> to draw the shapes inside the skin.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s super easy to add these types of transitions to your application!  Right-click on the application to see the source code.</p>

<p>Have fun making your Flex apps even sexier!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Adobe recently released an alpha version of <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air_linux.html">Adobe AIR for Linux</a> and a updated alpha 3 version of <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flexbuilder_linux.html">Flex Builder for Linux</a>.  I wanted to show everyone how easy it is to build and run desktop RIAs with Flex and Adobe AIR so I recorded a quick video.  In the video I use Papervision3D and a component I created called &#8220;TurbulentApplication&#8221; to turn an ordinary AIR Application into an application which pitches and rolls in response to the accelerometer values on my Ubuntu laptop.  While most AIR applications work on Windows, Mac, and Linux, this one only works on Linux because as far as I know Windows and Mac don&#8217;t have a way to read the accelerometer values from a file, like Linux.  If you have Linux (and an accelerometer) and want to run the application you can download it <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/videoTurbulence.air">here</a>.  If you want to download the source code for the TurbulentApplication component, you can get it <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/turbulence.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>Check out the video (and let me know what you think!):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/singlemoveperframeair.png" alt="" />Bubblemark is a popular benchmark for some of the RIA technologies including Flex, Adobe AIR, Ajax (DHTML), Java Swing, Java FX, Silverlight, etc.  I&#8217;ve been trying for a while to create a new Flex version of Bubblemark to show just how fast Flash Player and Adobe AIR are.  But I&#8217;ve come to a few realizations&#8230;  First, you can make benchmarks say whatever you want them to say.</p>

<p>When trying to optimize Bubblemark I found a few interesting things.  First was that IE (and some versions of Firefox) limit the frame rate of Flash Player (<a href="http://www.kaourantin.net/2006/05/frame-rates-in-flash-player.html">and possibly other plugins</a>).  This means that while the Flash Player VM might be able to actually achieve 200+ frames per second the actual visual result might be only 60 fps.  And maybe this is for good reason.  Why do you need a visual frame rate faster than the refresh rate on a monitor?  You don&#8217;t.  And especially not for RIAs.</p>

<p>Graphic rendering performance is certainly relevant for RIAs but that is only one factor which affects overall application performance.  <a href="http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/2008/04/off-bubblemark.html">As Chet Haase points out</a>, Bubblemark lumps a number of different factors - calculation speed, rendering performance, and timer resolution - into a single &#8220;frames per second&#8221; metric.  That leads to my second realization.</p>

<p>The frame rate of bouncing bubbles isn&#8217;t very relevant to RIAs.  As <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/joshy/archive/2008/04/at_the_speed_of.html">Josh Marinacci of Sun says</a> - &#8220;there aren&#8217;t any real benchmarks yet for rich internet applications.&#8221;  I think that my <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/census/">Census RIA benchmark</a> is more pertinent to RIAs than bouncing bubbles.  Census benchmarks how quickly an application can get data from a server, parse that data, and render the data in a datagrid.  Sorting and filtering are also important benchmarks that I&#8217;m working on integrating into Census.  Today the Census app has various Flex and Ajax tests but I&#8217;m also currently working on adding a Silverlight test, an Ext JS test, and an updated Dojo test.  I&#8217;d love it if someone would create a Java FX version as well.</p>

<p>Just for kicks let&#8217;s go back to Bubblemark and see what I was able to come up with (with help from <a href="http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/">Chet Haase</a>).  I created two versions of the new Flex Bubblemark application.  You can run each version in the browser (Flash Player) or on the desktop (Adobe AIR).  The results will vary between the web and desktop versions due to the browser throttling.  The first application will only move the bubbles once per frame.  This is similar to the original Flex Bubblemark application.  If the browser is only letting Flash Player run at 60 fps then the maximum fps will be 60.  Adobe AIR seems to limit the fps to 250 but I haven&#8217;t yet confirmed that.  With both of these versions CPU utilization should be pretty low since they are being artificially throttled.  The second set of applications moves the bubbles as many times as possible per frame.  The appearance of these might be choppy since the bubbles only get rendered after being moved potentially hundreds of times.  The second set of benchmarks is more real world if you are interested in VM processing speed as opposed to resolution of the timing mechanism.  However a third set of tests which is probably the most useful and that I haven&#8217;t yet written would calculate how many bubbles can be moved once per frame and maintain 60 fps.  That kind of metric is probably relevant to RIAs that need to do a lot on every frame.  But most RIAs I&#8217;ve seen are more concerned with the speed of data processing.  Here are the new Flex Bubblemark applications:</p>

<p>Single Move Per Frame: <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/Bubblemark/SingleMovePerFrameWeb.html">Web</a> | <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/Bubblemark/SingleMovePerFrame.air">Desktop</a> (requires Adobe AIR 1.0)
Many Moves Per Frame: <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/Bubblemark/ManyMovesPerFrameWeb.html">Web</a> | <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/Bubblemark/ManyMovesPerFrame.air">Desktop</a> (requires Adobe AIR 1.0)</p>

<p>(<a href="http://flexapps.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/flexapps/bubblemark/">Flex Bubblemark Source Code</a>)</p>

<p>Benchmarks are only useful when you apply them to your scenario.  Is the performance good enough for what you need?  Are your users able to run what you build?  There are thousands of RIAs which run in Flash Player and now hundreds of Adobe AIR applications.  For the millions of users of these applications the frame rate is fast enough and the VM performance is superb.  For the developers of these applications the Flex tooling enabled them to efficiently build these applications.  Not only do the runtimes and the tools work on Windows, Mac, and Linux - the runtimes and core development tools are free.  There is more to choosing a platform than the speed at which a runtime can bounce objects around the screen.  Sorry if I&#8217;ve burst any bubbles.</p>

In the new version I used <a href="http://dougmccune.com/blog/2007/11/19/flex-coverflow-performance-improvement-flex-carousel-component-and-vertical-coverflow/">Doug McCune&#8217;s CoverFlow component</a> but extended it to easily support playing videos.  Check out <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/myTube/myTube.html">a demo of the VideoCoverFlow component</a> and right-click to download the <a href="/myTube/srcview/index.html">source code</a>.  For those trying to use the VideoCoverFlow component - the implementation has changed slightly since I recorded the screencast so check out the myTube application for an example of how to use it.</p>

<p>Thanks Doug for the CoverFlow component.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today Adobe launched <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex 3</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Adobe AIR 1.0</a> – the most mature and comprehensive platform for Rich Internet Applications in existence.</p>

<p>The news of the launch is everywhere but I wanted to point out a few of the most exciting things related to this launch.</p>

<p>The Flex SDK and BlazeDS are now <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com">officially open source</a>.</p>

<p>InfoQ has published an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/flex3-update">interview with me</a> on the Flex 3 launch.  They have also posted an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/air-1.0-overview">interview with Kevin Hoyt</a> on the AIR 1.0 launch as well as <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/air-flex-release">an overview of today&#8217;s announcements</a>.</p>

<p>Salesforce.com and Adobe have launched the <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2008/02/25/announcing-the-forcecom-toolkit-for-adobe-air-and-flex/">Force.com Toolkit for Adobe AIR and Flex</a>.</p>

<p>Not really related to the launch but also very exciting – Chet Haase, Java Swing guru and co-author of Filthy Rich Clients has <a href="http://graphics-geek.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-hello-world.html">joined the Flex engineering team</a>.</p>

<p>This launch is the biggest RIA launch ever!  I can&#8217;t wait to see what you build with these awesome technologies!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost a year ago I began working with Ron Hess and Dave Carroll from Salesforce on the Flex Toolkit for Apex - a port of the JavaScript libraries for Salesforce.com&#8217;s web services.  Since that time the toolkit has matured and been used in numerous production applications.  Today I am pleased to announce the new Force.com Toolkit for Adobe AIR and Flex.  This new toolkit build on the Flex Toolkit for Apex and adds additional functionality for the new Adobe AIR runtime for desktop RIAs.</p>

<p>For more information on the new toolkit check out <a href="https://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/AIR_and_Flex_Toolkit">a tutorial I wrote</a> on how to use it.  Also visit <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/salesforce/">the new Salesforce page on the Adobe Developer Connection</a>.</p>

<p>It was very impressive seeing all of the amazing applications that were built with the original toolkit.  I can&#8217;t wait to see what you build with this new toolkit.  Let us know how it goes!</p>
