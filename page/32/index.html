  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s so much fun stuff going on it&#8217;s hard to keep my blog up-to-date.  But I did want to note a couple of things&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=193593">Bruce Eckel</a> will be at JavaOne!  He will spend some time in the Adobe booth and some time at various sessions.  But the big news is that he and I will be co-presenting a short session before the Adobe Party on Wednesday night.  This will be a fun thirty minute session that will be entertaining and educational.  Too bad this isn&#8217;t an official JavaOne session, but I guess Sun doesn&#8217;t want me presenting about Flex at JavaOne (They rejected my three submissions but possibly for other reasons.)  Following the short session will be the party.  Food, drinks, and hanging out with Bruce Eckel!  Stop by the Adobe booth at JavaOne to get your official invitation (which I think you will need to get in).</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/campaigns/developerconference/">free Salesforce conference</a> coming up on May 21st.  I&#8217;ll be co-presenting a session on the <a href="http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Flex_Toolkit">Flex Toolkit for Apex</a>.  This will be a great session for anyone who wants to build sexy apps with Flex and Apollo on top of Salesforce.  For those who haven&#8217;t yet tried out the Apex Toolkit you really should attend this session.  You know how you usually have to setup a database, maintain it, write lots of middleware code, maintain that, etc?  Well with Salesforce you don&#8217;t really have to do that.  You use the customizable Salesforce back-end and build your sexy Flex front-end.  It couldn&#8217;t be easier to build enterprise apps that are maintainable and sexy!  Come to the conference and learn more!</p>

<p>This past week Dick Wall of the <a href="http://www.javaposse.com">Java Posse</a> invited me to do a Google Tech Talk.  The session was recorded and <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1156113143758326102&amp;hl=en">posted on Google Video</a>.  Thanks Dick (and Google) for inviting me!  I had a great time!</p>

<p>Next week on May 15th I&#8217;ll be presenting at the <a href="http://www.sdjug.com/">San Diego JUG</a>.  If you are in the area I&#8217;d love to meet you in person.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now.  I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing many of you at JavaOne this week!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For close to a year I&#8217;ve been working (in my infrequent spare time) on an application that shows differences in data loading for RIAs (Rich Internet Applications), comparing Ajax methods, Ajax frameworks, and various Flex methods.  The results are pretty surprising.  The screenshot below is from a test run I did with the server running locally.  (Note for the screenshot below: All tests except Dojo were 5000 rows, while the Dojo test was 500 rows.)
<a href="http://www.jamesward.org/census/"><img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/census.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>To run the benchmarks yourself, go to:
<a href="http://www.jamesward.org/census/">http://www.jamesward.org/census/</a></p>

<p>I have tried to be as fair as possible with these tests.  Still, I encourage you to use these results only as an initial guide.  You should always do your own benchmarks that more closely resemble your actual use case.</p>

<p>You can find more details explaining the tests and the results inside the &#8220;Guide Me&#8221; mode of the application, so I won&#8217;t go into depth here.  Also, <a href="http://sf.net/projects/flexapps">the code</a> is Open Source (GPL) on SourceForge.  If you feel that a test should be done differently or you find other things that you think should be changed, get the code, fix it, and send me a patch file.  Please don&#8217;t just tell me I did something wrong.  In the spirit of Open Source, help me fix it.  I want this application to be as fair and accurate as possible.</p>

<p>While these results may be eye-opening to some, once you understand some fundamental differences between Flex and Ajax, they end up making a lot of sense.  Flex applications run within the Mozilla Tamarin VM inside Flash 9.  Tamarin does JIT compilation which makes code execution 10 to 1000 times faster than interpreted JavaScript in the browser.  Also Tamarin can be very efficient when dealing with typed objects.</p>

<p>In addition, Flex supports a compact binary object serialization protocol, called AMF3, which is extremely fast.  There are numerous Open Source implementations using various backend technologies for AMF3, as well as a commercial / supported Adobe product, called Flex Data Services.  If you control both sides of the wire in your application, then there is rarely a good reason to serialize and deserialize text.  Objects are blazing fast as you can tell by this benchmark.  AMF3 is also typically much more efficient across the wire (even without compression) and consumes much less client side memory.  JIT compilation and binary object serialization are the primary reasons why Flex AMF3 is so fast, even in the test with the full 20,000 rows.  And, it’s not just faster for loading - it also speeds client side sorting and filtering.  (Try client-side sorting in the Dojo benchmark and the Flex AMF benchmark.)</p>

<p>A quick note on compression:  I did not include compression support in this version because its value really depends on many application-specific factors.  For instance, if most of your users have slow connections then compression can help speed things up, but if most have fast connections the added latency can actually make things slower.  However, I do want to add a Gzip option to this benchmark for the next release.</p>

<p>This is really a version 0.1 release.  There are many improvements I have on the to-do list.  And I&#8217;d love the community&#8217;s help.  Here are some things I want to do for the 0.2 release:
 - Add Gzip option on tests
 - Add a Laszlo test
 - Implement more Ajax frameworks that have DataGrids and that support paging and sorting
 - Add a server side sorting option
 - Add Ajax client side memory usage metrics (don&#8217;t know if this is possible)
 - Improve the UI for use on projectors (I use this demo in every presentation I give)
 - Integrate feedback I get from the initial version
 - Maybe add a WPF/E test (which I won&#8217;t be able to do because I run Linux)</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that you find this demo useful.  I built it as a tool to help people learn more about the various methods of data loading in RIAs.  I did not in any way build this to attack Ajax, Dojo, and SOAP.  Please help me improve this application so that we all continue to learn more about the technologies available to us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200704/042607Flex.html">Flex is going Open Source!</a>  This is really, really exciting news!  I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this moment since before I worked at Macromedia.  This will certainly change RIA programming in a major way.  But what does this mean for you:
1) There will be a formal process for contributing to Flex.
2) Your voice is important.  Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/flex-open-source">Open Source Flex Google Group</a>.
3) You aren&#8217;t locked into a single vendor&#8217;s monetization strategy.  So is Flex now part of the &#8220;Open Web&#8221;?  I think so.
4) More rapid innovation.  Adobe has some really smart people.  Combine those with a ton of other really smart people and we get better products, faster.
5) Adobe continues down the Open Source road.  Tamarin was a huge step.  Now Adobe takes another.
6) OEMs can more easily adopt Flex.
7) Open Source Flex can be redistributed.
8) Open Source Flex will further stimulate the already booming Flex ecosystem.
9) Flex is bigger than Adobe.  Watch as many big organizations further invest in Flex.
10) Flex is going Open Source!  &#8216;nuf said.</p>

<p>More information is available in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/opensourceflex">the FAQ</a>.  Come join us!  Together we will revolutionize the now-more-sexy &#8220;Open Web&#8221;!  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago I met with Salesforce.com about Flex and Apollo.  They had begun building some Flex applications that used the Flex Ajax Bridge to communicate with Salesforce.  This worked but they wanted to be able to more easily build Flex and Apollo applications.  So I took their JavaScript library and did an initial port to ActionScript.  Surprisingly the code ported pretty easily.  It was actually a fascinating experiment.  ActionScript 3 is based on the same specification as JavaScript 2, so in theory this kind of thing should be pretty trivial &#8211; especially if the code being ported doesn&#8217;t do much with the browser DOM.  That was the situation in this case because the Salesforce JavaScript library talks to their backend via XHR and doesn&#8217;t do much with the browser DOM.  Once I had an initial port done including authentication and query support Ron and Dave from Salesforce.com cleaned everything up, added better object typing, built complex examples, and developed an Apollo demo.  Everything has been going on under a semi-secret SourceForge project, code named Mavericks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adobe Flex Toolkit for Apex&#8221; is the formal name for this new Flex / Apollo library.  The library is licensed under BSD so everyone can easily reuse it in their applications.  Because it uses a simple asynchronous communications model and typed objects wherever possible, this new library accelerates the process of building Flex and Apollo applications on top of the Salesforce.com Apex platform.  With just a few lines of code you can get data from Salesforce.com and render it in your application.  There are three primary ways to use this toolkit.  You can use it to build Apollo based desktop applications, create custom web applications hosted on your site, or build a custom S-Control hosted on Salesforce.com.  For instructions on how to build a custom S-Control and the basics of using the toolkit, check out the <a href="http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Tutorial:_Creating_Flex_Salesforce_Mashups">Creating Flex Salesforce Mashups</a> tutorial.</p>

<p>Here is what you need to do to build an Apollo application using the Flex Toolkit for Apex.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download the toolkit:
<a href="http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Members:Flex_Toolkit_download">http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Members:Flex_Toolkit_download</a></p></li>
<li><p>If you haven&#8217;t already done so, install Flex Builder and the Apollo Extensions:
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/tryflex">http://www.adobe.com/go/tryflex</a>
<a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/apollo/">http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/apollo/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Create a new Apollo Project
<img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/salesforce1.png" alt="salesforce1.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Add the Salesforce SWC to the Library Build Path
<img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/salesforce2.png" alt="salesforce2.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Write your Apollo application:</p>

<p>&lt;?xml version=&#8221;1.0&#8221; encoding=&#8221;utf-8&#8221;?>
&lt;mx:ApolloApplication xmlns:mx=&#8221;http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml&#8221; xmlns:salesforce=&#8221;http://www.salesforce.com/&#8221;
  creationComplete=&#8221;conn.loginWithCredentials(&#8216;dev@mavericks.demo&#8217;, &#8216;123456&#8217;, new AsyncResponder(loginResult, loginFault));&#8221;></p>

<p>  &lt;mx:Script>
  &lt;![CDATA[
  import mx.controls.Alert;
  import com.salesforce.results.QueryResult;
  import com.salesforce.AsyncResponder;</p>

<p>  private function loginResult(result:Object):void
  {</p>

<pre><code>conn.query("SELECT Id, Contact.Firstname, Contact.Lastname FROM Contact",
  new AsyncResponder(queryResult));
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  private function loginFault(fault:Object):void
  {</p>

<pre><code>Alert.show("Login error!");
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  private function queryResult(qr:QueryResult):void
  {</p>

<pre><code>dg.dataProvider = qr.records;
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  ]]>
  &lt;/mx:Script></p>

<p>  &lt;salesforce:Connection id=&#8221;conn&#8221;/></p>

<p>  &lt;mx:DataGrid id=&#8221;dg&#8221; width=&#8221;100%&#8221; height=&#8221;100%&#8221;/></p>

<p>&lt;/mx:ApolloApplication></p></li>
<li><p>Save it (which automatically compiles it)</p></li>
<li><p>Run it
<img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/salesforce3.png" alt="salesforce3.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Export it as an installable AIR file so you can share it with others</p></li>
<li><p>Say “WOW!”</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It really is that easy.  To learn more check out the examples in the toolkit.  Also if you really want to dive in, the toolkit is 100% Open Source so you can look at all the code and even help us improve it.  Check it out from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sforce">SourceForge SVN repository</a>.  I&#8217;m working on another article which will walk you through setting up the environment to begin hacking on the toolkit using either the Free Flex SDK or Flex Builder (we support both methods).  I hope you find the toolkit useful and please let me know what cool things you build with it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry this blog has been pretty stagnant lately.  Things have been totally crazy.  I&#8217;ve been touring the country speaking at Java User Groups and other conferences.  The JUGs have been really fun.  It&#8217;s amazing to see how quickly the Java crowd falls in love with Flex, like I did a few years ago.  There are still more JUGs, conferences, and eSeminars coming up so please check out <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/events/index.html">the schedule</a> and see if I happen to be in your home town sometime soon.  If you will be around the Bay Area for JavaOne, we will be throwing a huge bash with Bruce Eckel.  The details are still being finalized, but stay tuned.  Also coming in October is <a href="http://adobemax2007.com/">the annual Adobe developer conference, called MAX</a>.  It will be full of top notch Flex sessions by many of our star engineers.  Definitely not something you want to miss.  In May I&#8217;ll be doing a triple header in Vegas; <a href="http://vegasaug.org/">Las Vegas Adobe User Group</a>, <a href="http://www.nevadajug.org/index.php">Nevada Java User Group</a>, and <a href="http://www.interop.com/">Interop</a>.  Hopefully some of these events are in your home town since I&#8217;d love to meet you all in person!</p>

<p>Four other quick things&#8230;</p>

<p>Today we announced the <a href="http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Flex_Toolkit">Adobe Flex Toolkit for Apex</a> which allows you to very easily create Flex &amp; Apollo apps on top of SalesForce.  I have been working on this project for a few months so it&#8217;s exciting to see it launch.  I&#8217;ll be posting another blog in the next few days with more details about using the new Toolkit in Apollo applications.  But if you want to get started, check out the <a href="http://wiki.apexdevnet.com/index.php/Tutorial:_Creating_Flex_Salesforce_Mashups">Creating Flex Salesforce Mashups</a> tutorial.</p>

<p>A while back <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/flexjava.html">Bruce Eckel and I recorded a screencast</a> of us building a Flex application with Hibernate and XFire on the backend.  I finally got around to packaging the code for that demo.  You can get it from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=174131&amp;package_id=227161&amp;release_id=498451">SourceForge</a>.</p>

<p>My friend Tony in Japan created a pretty <a href="http://www.silver-island.com/apps/FlexDiff/">cool Flex app that does text diffs</a>.  Very cool and nice use of vectors!  Thanks Tony!</p>

<p>Lastly, there has been lots of great developments going on with the <a href="http://buni.org/mediawiki/index.php/Meldware_Communications_Suite">Meldware Communications Suite</a>.  They use Flex for the webmail client.  It is coming along very well, but we need some help.  If you know Flex and want to get involved in a great Open Source Flex project, get more info on <a href="http://blog.buni.org/blog/default/buni/2007/04/15/Volunteers-wanted">the buni.org site</a>.  Also, Meldware is doing a Linux User Group tour.  <a href="http://buni.org/mediawiki/index.php/LUG_TOUR_2007">Check out their schedule</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on a project that compiles 11 Flex applications.  My Ant build file was getting pretty messy and I was continually commenting out files that I didn&#8217;t want to build.  By using an Ant macro and some uptodate trickery I was able to significantly decrease my build times when I am only updating files for a single application.  The macro also helped to make the build much more manageable.</p>

<p>You can find the whole build here:
<a href="http://flexapps.cvs.sourceforge.net/flexapps/census/build.xml?revision=1.14&amp;view=markup">http://flexapps.cvs.sourceforge.net/flexapps/census/build.xml?revision=1.14&view;=markup</a></p>

<p>First I setup a macro:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;macrodef name="compileflex"&gt;
    &lt;attribute name="src"/&gt;
    &lt;attribute name="dest"/&gt;
    &lt;element name="uptodatefiles" optional="true"/&gt;
    &lt;sequential&gt;
      &lt;uptodate property="@{src}.uptodate" targetfile="@{dest}"&gt;
        &lt;srcfiles file="@{src}"/&gt;
        &lt;srcfiles file="build/base.swc"/&gt;
        &lt;srcfiles file="${src.flex.dir}/flex.css"/&gt;
        &lt;uptodatefiles/&gt;
      &lt;/uptodate&gt;
      &lt;antcall target="compilemxml"&gt;
        &lt;param name="src" value="@{src}"/&gt;
        &lt;param name="dest" value="@{dest}"/&gt;
      &lt;/antcall&gt;
    &lt;/sequential&gt;
  &lt;/macrodef&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The macro calls the &#8220;compilemxml&#8221; target when the swf is not up-to-date.  The compilemxml target is a pretty plain Ant target:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;target name="compilemxml" unless="${src}.uptodate"&gt;
    &lt;java jar="${flex.sdk.dir}/lib/mxmlc.jar" fork="true" maxmemory="128m"&gt;
      &lt;jvmarg value="-Dapplication.home=${flex.sdk.dir}"/&gt;
      &lt;arg value="-external-library-path+=build/base.swc"/&gt;
      &lt;arg value="-runtime-shared-libraries=base.swf"/&gt;
      &lt;arg value="-licenses.license" /&gt;
      &lt;arg value="charting"/&gt;
      &lt;arg value="${charting}"/&gt;
      &lt;arg value="-compiler.services" /&gt;
      &lt;arg value="etc/flex/services-config.xml" /&gt;
      &lt;arg value="-compiler.context-root" /&gt;
      &lt;arg value="/census" /&gt;
      &lt;arg value="-file-specs" /&gt;
      &lt;arg value="${src}" /&gt;
      &lt;arg value="-output" /&gt;
      &lt;arg value="${dest}" /&gt;
    &lt;/java&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The macro is simple to use:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;compileflex src="${src.flex.dir}/flex_soap_as.mxml" dest="build/census.war/flex_soap_as.swf"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In that instance, the uptodate check will check the src file, the swc, and the css to see if they are uptodate.  If any of them were updated more recently than the swf, then compilemxml will be called.  If you have other unique files which need to also be checked, you can pass those in a uptodatefiles element:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;compileflex src="${src.flex.dir}/index.mxml" dest="build/census.war/index.swf"&gt;
      &lt;uptodatefiles&gt;
        &lt;srcfiles file="${src.flex.dir}/Test.as"/&gt;
        &lt;srcfiles dir="${src.flex.dir}" includes="Wizard*"/&gt;
        &lt;srcfiles file="${src.flex.dir}/IFrame.mxml"/&gt;
        &lt;srcfiles file="${src.flex.dir}/BarItemRenderer.as"/&gt;
        &lt;srcfiles file="${src.flex.dir}/ChartBackgroundFill.as"/&gt;
        &lt;srcfiles file="${src.flex.dir}/ChartLegendCombo.mxml"/&gt;
        &lt;srcfiles file="${src.flex.dir}/CustomAxisRenderer.mxml"/&gt;
        &lt;srcfiles file="${src.flex.dir}/DataGridHeaderSeparator.as"/&gt;
      &lt;/uptodatefiles&gt;
    &lt;/compileflex&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The one kinda-hack I had to do to make this work, was to make sure that the property which gets set by the uptodate task is unique for each time compileflex is called.  I used the ${src}.uptodate property name to accomplish this.</p>

<p>This build is pretty catered to my needs, however, you should be able to easily customize it to fit your needs.  I hope you find this useful.  Let me know if you have any questions!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Long ago I remember the first Flash site I ever saw&#8211;spinning gears replaced typically boring site navigation and sound illuminated a previously silent web.  My jaw dropped and I said to myself, &#8220;I want to build these kinds of websites!&#8221;  After playing with Flash Professional for days, I realized that my mathematically inclined brain just could not output the kind of beauty that I began to see all over the Flash powered web.  I gave up and resorted to building very ugly HTML interfaces.  Not because I didn&#8217;t want them to look better but rather, it was just too much work and I lacked the skill.</p>

<p>As time passed my attitude changed from Flash is very cool, to all these &#8216;skip into&#8217; sites have gotten very annoying.  I also gave up hope of learning to create Flash sites myself, due to my ever-growing ideology of Freedom, prompting me to switch to Linux on the desktop.  And this meant running Flash Professional was no longer an option.  Over the next few years hanging out on Slashdot led me to believe that since Flash was so abused, it really lacked value.  When I first saw a simple web form built with Flash I laughed and said, &#8220;Why would anyone use Flash for these types of applications?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2005, my boss was a very creative person who wanted our corporate marketing website to be more like the Hidalgo movie site, than a static printed brochure.  It was a fantastic vision that the executives liked, so we began researching technologies.  I was against using Flash Professional for a number of reasons.  I still was (and still am) using Linux on my desktop and I didn&#8217;t think Flash was the right tool for web applications.  I am a programmer who likes to write code, not play with movie clips on timelines, and the site we were building also had to function as a customer service website with complex backend interaction, data editing and data visualization.</p>

<p>My boss came into work one morning after having been to a Flex briefing, jazzed that she had found the answer, &#8220;Let’s build it with Flex!&#8221;  I responded by asking what was this Flex thing.  I began looking around and I first saw the component explorer.  Initially I thought everything looked great, but I was still unaware of how to build that kind of stuff and talk to the backend.  I downloaded the trial, and dug in.</p>

<p>Within an hour I was pulling data from my backend and displaying it in a data grid that would have taken me weeks to build with HTML and a few days later I had built a POC for the portal we began building.  I was extremely impressed with how quickly I learned Flex and built beautiful, functional stuff.  I was pretty hooked, but still had all those lingering fears about using Flash.  My main concerns were that Flash was proprietary, only used for annoyances, was not indexable by search engines, Macromedia had not been super Linux friendly, and Flash is a browser plug-in.</p>

<p>So how did I overcome my fears and jump head first into the Flash/Flex world, eventually becoming an evangelist for Flex?  Before I begin, the following is not meant to be a point-by-point argument for why to use Flash and Flex.  I save those for when I am confronted with specific use cases.  The following is more about my specific use case, which may or may not apply to your use case.  If you want to talk specifically about your use case please ping me.  I&#8217;d love to hear what you are building and honestly talk about whether Flash and Flex is the best fit.</p>

<p><em>Fear #1: It&#8217;s proprietary</em></p>

<p>Being a Linux geek who compiles almost everything on my system from source, this was probably my biggest issue with using Flash as a platform.  In my mind it comes down to three things: can I deconstruct Flash content without Macromedia (now Adobe) software?  Can I construct Flash content without Adobe software?  And, how tightly controlled is the innovation and direction of the Flash platform?</p>

<p>There are plenty of more religious reasons to fear Flash, but for my personal beliefs, those were the main three.  As far as deconstructing Flash content, I was happy to learn that the SWF (Flash byte code) file spec is published and there are at least three open source Flash browser plug-ins.  To construct SWF content numerous open source projects exist, including a Flex-like framework called Laszlo.  And as far as community participation goes, I was pleased to learn that Flash and many other Macromedia/Adobe products are driven by Customer Advisory Boards and feedback received by the general public.</p>

<p>These facts were enough to satisfy Fear #1.  I&#8217;m sure there are those out there like RMS, for whom these reasons are not enough.  And let me make it clear that I firmly believe in the ideals that RMS believes.  But in my mind there are people who are meant to fight for an ideal, bringing balance to the world and people who are meant to live in contradiction.  Simply put, there are areas where I will sacrifice my ideals and there are areas I won&#8217;t.  Flash is one of those areas where I have no problem living in a contradictory reality.  Most of us live in such a reality.  Is your Operating System Open Source?   How about your video driver, your MP3 Player or the software behind the websites you use?  I&#8217;m fine with Flash not being Open Source because ultimately I trust Adobe to continue doing the right thing and eventually make Flash more open.  And I believe this for a few reasons.  One, the PDF specification recently became an Open Standard with ISO.  Two, Adobe recently open sourced the source behind the core of Flash Player, its virtual machine, with Mozilla.  And three, I&#8217;ve never felt that Flash Player didn&#8217;t put my interests as a consumer ahead of Adobe&#8217;s corporate interests.  For Flash Player to be successful, they must serve the consumers of the technology.</p>

<p><em>Fear #2: It&#8217;s only used for annoyances</em></p>

<p>Indisputably, the power of Flash has been abused.  Pop-ups, pop-overs, skip intros and annoying ads run rampant across our screens.  I&#8217;ve heard it said that one should never judge a religion by its abuse. The same adage applies to technology.  Flash shouldn&#8217;t be avoided just because people use it for annoying things.  After all, e-mail isn&#8217;t avoided just because spammers happen to abuse it.</p>

<p>We need to find creative ways to deal with the abuse.  I personally would like to see a community-driven black list of Flash and DHTML abuses, similar to email RBLs.  The more useful a technology is the more abused it will be.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean we should stop using useful technologies.</p>

<p><em>Fear #3: It&#8217;s not indexable (or what I call &#8220;Integration with Web 1.0&#8221;)</em></p>

<p>When the web consisted primarily of documents, indexing worked really well.  Spiders could easily crawl through URLs to obtain all documents in existence.  As the web has become more of an application platform this method has begun to break down.  Whether it&#8217;s Ajax, Flash or XUL, when an application moves state and code execution to the client, it becomes harder and harder for the search engines to index.</p>

<p>For the site that I built with Flex this was a critical issue, but it was resolved by creating a boring Lynx compatible version of our site.  Since a content management system contained all of the content for the site it was a simple task and our problem was solved.  However, I think there is still more work to be done.  Search engines need to innovate in this area, perhaps by creating a web services interface to allow for application indexing.  Since modern search engines rely on the interconnectedness of pages, creating a different, indexable version of your site will reduce your search engine ranking.  However, by looking at sites like Digg and Delicious it would be easy to conceive some way to rate and moderate the usefulness and integrity of the new &#8220;application index&#8221;.</p>

<p>What about back button support?  In Flex, back button support is built in and easily customizable so this was never an issue.  Flex also provides an easy way to do hashmark urls (or named anchors) so the url changes as application state changes.  Another Web 1.0 integration problem solved.</p>

<p><em>Fear #4: Macromedia has not been super Linux friendly</em></p>

<p>Flash Player for Linux releases have historically lagged behind the Windows releases, and  there have been very few ways to build SWFs on Linux systems.  For some the lack of a native 64bit Linux Flash Player has also been a big problem.  These factors have long contributed to many Linux users feeling that they are second-class citizens in the Flash world, myself included.</p>

<p>Before I joined Macromedia, plans were in the works for Flash Player 9.  I had a heart-to-heart with <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/emmy">Emmy Huang</a> about Macromedia&#8217;s Linux support and she assured me that Flash Player 9 on Linux was of the utmost priority.  She also said one main hold-up was filling the open positions for a few great Linux programmers to port/build Flash Player 9 on Linux.  Finally <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/">Mike Melanson</a> found the job posting and relocated to SF to join the Flash Player team.  He and many others fiendishly worked on Flash Player 9 for Linux and did a fantastic job!  Public betas for Flash Player 9 on Linux began a few months after the Windows and Mac releases, and Flash Player 9 for Linux was officially released on January 17, 2007.  And for those on 64bit Linux, using the nspluginwrapper, you can run the 32bit Flash plug-in.</p>

<p>Adobe now has numerous full time engineers building and testing Flash Player 9 on Linux.  Also, it&#8217;s important to consider how committed Adobe has been to Adobe Reader working on Linux.  In my opinion Reader support on Linux is fantastic.  Adobe is extremely committed to making sure that platform technologies not only work on Linux, but also work the same way on Linux as they do on Windows and Mac.</p>

<p>Adobe is also committed to making sure that Linux users can not only view Flash content, but also create it.  With tools like the free Flex 2 SDK, which I use daily on Linux, I am able to build Flash-based applications that take advantage of all the innovative features of Flash and run the same way on Linux, Mac and Windows.  The free Flex 2 SDK provides a set of reusable components, a compiler and debugger that allows me to build web applications that are faster, more usable, and more aesthetically appealing than anything I could build with HTML and JavaScript.</p>

<p><em>Fear #5: It&#8217;s a browser plug-in</em></p>

<p>This was only a short-lived issue for me, so I&#8217;ll save the verbosity for a future blog.  I believe that the concept of Browser Plug-ins was added to allow innovation outside of a snail’s pace seen in the browsers themselves.  This gives web users the ability to go beyond the realm of HTML and experience amazing things within the context of a page accessed via HTTP.  Flash provided just this, a consistent, innovative experience inside the browser, yet outside the limitations of HTML.  Now 98 percent of the world&#8217;s PC users have Flash 6 or greater installed.</p>

<p>So why is there such an aversion to relying on a browser plug-in?  Last time I checked more users have Flash enabled than JavaScript.  Should we never rely on JavaScript either?  And what about browser compatibility?  Plug-ins, like Flash, do a great job of shielding web developers from the pains of cross-browser and cross-OS incompatibilities.  From a web developer perspective I&#8217;m much happier when I can write once, debug once and run anywhere, than having to test on three different OS&#8217;s and over 20 different browser permutations.  Many say that frameworks shield us from these cross-X issues.  I don’t think they do, because almost every piece of software I write ends up being about 80 percent framework and 20 percent hand coded.  People always end up having to deal with a slice of the application that falls outside what the frameworks does.</p>

<p>Also, a side note on Flex.  The Flex programming model was conceived as a component framework where components are extensible and include properties, methods, styles and events.  In my experiences by encapsulating these elements into a framework I rarely have to go outside the bounds of the Flex framework.  With HTML and Ajax frameworks I frequently have to drop down to lower level code, outside the framework.  Usually at first the framework gives me everything I need.  Then the designers hand me something that looks nothing like what the framework provides out-of-the-box and I have to start hacking around the framework or even modifying the framework itself.  This is not a maintainable way to code!  With Flex I simply tell designers to use a designer friendly tool to create the design elements.  Then I import those elements into my Flex application as skins.</rabbit trail></p>

<p>Obviously there are things that Flash can do very well that the browser can&#8217;t do, or can&#8217;t do well.  People are working to change this.  But how long will it be before new standards are created, how long before browsers implement those standards and a majority of users upgrade to those browsers?  I’d prefer not to hold my breath, because by the time that is all done the web will be nothing like it is today.  Plug-ins are a harbor for innovation, stability and consistency.  So why do we treat them as if they aren&#8217;t just as important as the browser?  And with free products like the Flex Ajax Bridge it&#8217;s easy to communicate between Flash and the browser, as illustrated by Google Finance.</p>

<p><em>Fears Relieved</em></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the point, Flash Player IS a ubiquitous, cross-browser, cross-OS virtual machine enabling next generation web experiences.  Flex is a simple tool for developers to build applications that execute in the Flash virtual machine.  In most use cases Flex applications take less time to build and result in better user experiences.  Flex isn&#8217;t for everyone, or for every use case, but I hope my experiences have shed light on the whether or not Flex and Flash are a good fit for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago <a href="http://hurlant.com/">Metal</a> pointed out to me in a <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2006/11/27/howto-reduce-the-size-of-your-flex-app/#comment-4802">comment on my blog</a> that by using the SWFs inside a SWC, my RSLs are much larger than they need to be.  Sure enough he was right.  When you use compc to create a SWC, the SWF inside the SWC contains a lot of unnecessary stuff when used as an RSL.  That stuff is necessary to create an application which uses the SWC, so don&#8217;t go ditching compc.  Here is what you need to do if you want to have size optimized RSLs:</p>

<p>1) Create an ActionScript class that extends Sprite and includes references to the stuff you want to go into your RSL.  For instance:</p>

<p>`package
{
import flash.display.Sprite;
import mx.core.Application;</p>

<p>public class smallLinker extends Sprite
{</p>

<pre><code>private var application:Application;
</code></pre>

<p>}
}`</p>

<p>2) Compile your SWC:</p>

<p><code>compc -debug=false -o=my.swc smallLinker</code></p>

<p>3) Compile your RSL:</p>

<p><code>mxmlc -o=my.swf -file-specs=smallLinker.as</code></p>

<p>4) Compile your application:</p>

<p><code>mxmlc -external-library-path+=my.swc \
  -runtime-shared-libraries=http://www.yourhost.com/my.swf \
  -o=app.swf -file-specs=app.mxml</code></p>

<p>5) Upload app.swf and my.swf to your host.</p>

<p>6) Run your application and verify it works.</p>

<p>7) Send me a check for the money you save on bandwidth (Don&#8217;t worry Metal, we will split it 60/40).</p>

<p>If you compare the size of the SWF inside the SWC and the SWF created with mxmlc, you should see a very large difference.  Since your new SWF is much smaller than your old one, your application will take less time to load across the wire.  Fun stuff!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I was doing an impromptu session at <a href="http://www.silvafug.org/">Slivafug</a> when I discovered Easing Functions in Flex.  I love it when after almost three years with a technology I can still just stumble across something amazingly cool!  Easing functions allow you to apply non-linear motion to effects.  There are many types of effects which you could apply easing functions to, but I&#8217;ve only touched the surface by playing with Move effects and Series Interpolation on charts.  I&#8217;ve created a little demo application to show off Flex&#8217;s built-in easing functions:
<a href="/easingFunctionFun/easingFunctionFun.html">Fun with Easing Functions Demo</a></p>

<p>This application was very simple to build.  You can get the source via right-click in the demo, or <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/easingFunctionFun/srcview/index.html">here</a>.  Have fun with those Easing Functions!</p>
