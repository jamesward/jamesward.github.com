  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that 2007 is almost over.  It&#8217;s been an amazing year!  Thanks for reading and contributing.  I&#8217;m looking forward to another great year in 2008.  And it all begins when I hit the road the second week of January for <a href="http://www.codemash.org">CodeMash 2008</a>.  I went to CodeMash last year and really enjoyed the conference, especially the water slides.  :)  I&#8217;ll be speaking again at CodeMash 2008 about Adobe AIR and Flex.</p>

<p>The week following CodeMash there will be a <a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/RIAJam/Index.php">RIA Jam in Ann Arbor</a>.  The RIA Jam will be hosted by <a href="http://srtsolutions.com/">SRT Solutions</a> and <a href="http://www.mindview.net/">Bruce Eckel</a>.  My friend and co-RIA-conspirator, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joshholmes/">Josh Holmes</a>, will also be there helping people learn Silverlight while I help people learn Flex and AIR.  In February Bruce will also be hosting another <a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/FlexTGJam/Index.php">Flex Jam in Crested Butte, Colorado</a>. The Jam in February will cover Flex, TurboGears, integrating the two and hopefully some exploratory work into integrating Flex with <a href="http://liftweb.net">Lift</a>, the new Scala based web framework.  I will be there helping people learn Flex and undoubtedly learning some new things myself.</p>

<p>The Jam and Open Spaces style events that Bruce hosts are my favorite events of the year.  The events in Crested Butte are always so refreshing.  While most conferences keep me indoors for days at a time, Bruce&#8217;s event encourage attendees to get outside, into open spaces.  For me this helps to relax my mind which makes it much easier to learn and focus.  At the Crested Butte events in the summer we hike for a few hours every day and in the winter we ski / snowshoe.  These events are also incredibly affordable since there isn&#8217;t a high cost associated with putting them on.  And as a bonus attendees to the Jams will receive a free copy of Flex Builder 2.  If you are learning Flex, no matter what level, you will learn more in these few days than you will at any other conference.  They are hands-on events so you actually learn through experimentation and peer interaction.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be at many other events in 2008 and hope to see many of you somewhere along the way.  Until then have a happy and safe holiday season.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Update: I&#8217;ve merged BlazeBench and Census into a <a href="/census">single demo</a>.  There is a known bug in in Firefox 3 due to a change in IFrame handling.  To start the test when using FF3 you need to click on the results panel.</p>

<p>Today Adobe released BlazeDS, an open source Java implementation of AMF based remoting and messaging.  This is huge news for the Flex, Flash, Adobe AIR and Java communities!  I can&#8217;t wait to break the news with Bruce Eckel in a few hours at the JavaPolis day 2 Keynote!  Check out the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200712/121307BlazeDS.html">press release</a>.  And go <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/blazeds/">download the bits</a>.  And take a look at my new <a href="/blazebench/">BlazeBench application</a> which shows why you want AMF and BlazeDS.  Right-click on the application to find the source code on SourceForge.  I&#8217;ll roll out a binary and source build in the next week or so.  We have also officially published the AMF spec!</p>

<p>[Please note that my server is probably going pretty taxed for the next few days so the results you see might vary from normal results.  When I publish the binary version of this app you will be able to run it locally and see more accurate results.  Notice how much time it&#8217;s taking my server to create those large data packets and gzip them?  One more reason that AMF is great!  Super fast without the need for gzip!]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday was a monumental day for Flash Player.  For the first time ever, a major release of Flash Player was simultaneously shipped for all three of the major operating systems - Windows, Mac, and Linux!  This illustrates Adobe&#8217;s commitment to being truly cross-platform.  There isn&#8217;t a ubiquitous platform in existence that is as committed to cross-platform compatibility as Adobe is with Flash Player.  This is one of the things I love about Flash Player.  Sun promised us &#8220;Write Once, Run Anywhere&#8221; with Java and yet they have never been able to really deliver it.  Theoretically maybe, but in reality how many Java apps / applets do you see with the breadth of use that Flash Player has?  Despite Java&#8217;s disappointing failure of true ubiquitous cross-platform compatibility I am hopeful that the OpenJDK will fix this.  The OpenJDK does seem to be fixing the recent problem of Java 6 not being available on OS X.</p>

<p>Congrats to the Flash Player team!  This is a significant milestone that everyone benefits from!</p>

<p>For those of you building Flex applications you can download the debug versions of this new release <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html">here</a>.  Also there is more information about all the great new features and bug fixes in this release on <a href="http://www.kaourantin.net/2007/12/adobe-flash-player-9-update-3-released.html">Tinic&#8217;s blog</a>, <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2007/12/flash_player_9_update_3_final.html">Mike&#8217;s blog</a>, and <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/emmy/archives/2007/12/flash_player_9_10.cfm">Emmy&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was at Dreamforce this year I had the chance to do a video interview with Peter Coffee from Salesforce.com.  In this interview we discussed the industry momentum behind RIAs in enterprise software and how Flex, Adobe AIR, and Force.com are being combined to deliver much better user experiences in business applications.  The recorded interview is below.  You can also find the original post on <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2007/11/as-ive-previous.html">Peter Coffee&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Admittedly I know very little about concurrent computing.  But the consensus seems to be that it&#8217;s the future.  We can&#8217;t keep building faster CPUs so we are just going with more of them.  This presents a problem for software that can&#8217;t easily be split into pieces.  If some CPU intensive piece of code can&#8217;t be chopped up to run in parallel then it is constrained by the speed of a single CPU.  So what is the solution?  Some think that the programming models need to change to better accommodate parallel computing.  The problem is that no matter how smart the programming model is at splitting stuff up you are always going to be blocked by IO operations - memory, ram, network, etc.  Others think that one solution may be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_memory">Transactional Memory</a>.  This can potentially alleviate the problem of threads waiting for locks.</p>

<p>Allegedly Sun is working on implementing Transactional Memory in their next generation of processors.  Now what if the Sun Java Virtual Machine were tuned to run unbelievably fast on these new processors?  One missing piece to this theory is the programming model.  I haven&#8217;t done a lot of concurrent programming but I hear it&#8217;s quite difficult to get right in Java.  <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214627">Allegedly</a> the concept of Agents in Scala (which runs on the JVM) makes concurrent programming much easier.  Combine Agents with Transaction Memory and a JVM tuned to take advantage of it and maybe we could see a significant performance boost associated with the multi-core/cpu machines.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always liked Sun hardware but with the low cost of Intel and AMD hardware the additional cost may not seem worth it.  However if Sun hardware ran my Java 10x faster I&#8217;d be totally sold.  Now that is an interesting way for Sun to monetize Java&#8230;  At least for a while.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago I was able to participate in a Chalk Talk with Salesforce.com and StakeWare.  The session focused on how Rich Internet Applications, Flex, and Adobe AIR relate to the Force.com platform.  With this combination of technologies companies like StakeWare can quickly build business applications that have rich user interfaces that work the same across browsers and operating systems.</p>

<p>PodTech recorded the session and have split it into three parts [<a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/4494/forcecom-chalk-talk-salesforcecom-adobe-and-stakeware">part1</a>, <a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/4509/forcecom-chalk-talk-salesforcecom-adobe-and-stakeware-part-2">part2</a>, <a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/4510/forcecom-chalk-talk-salesforcecom-adobe-and-stakeware-part-3">part3</a>].

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At Oracle OpenWorld on Tuesday and then on Wednesday at Larry Ellison&#8217;s keynote the seventh Flex application announced at OpenWorld was demonstrated.  Like <a href="/wordpress/2007/11/15/oracle-chooses-flex-part-5-sales-prospector/">Sales Prospector</a> and <a href="/wordpress/2007/11/15/oracle-chooses-flex-part-6-sales-library/">Sales Library</a> this application, Sales Campaign, is part of the larger Oracle CRM OnDemand suite that is scheduled to go live in the first half of 2008.  The Sales Campaign application allows sales people to easily create and track the success of their campaigns.  Like all the other Flex applications Oracle showed over the past few days the interface is simple, clean, and effective.  Exactly what users want!  Great job Oracle!  Here is a photo of Sales Campaign from the Tuesday session (courtesy of Todd Ruhl - my personal photographer assistant - just kidding - Todd has been an instrumental part of educating Oracle about Flex and getting Flex adopted at Oracle):</p>

<p><img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/sales_campaign.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>That&#8217;s about it for this seven part series on all the new Flex projects Oracle announced at OpenWorld.  Seems like maybe we should do a recap.  Coming soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The second Flex application which Oracle demonstrated at Ed Abbo&#8217;s keynote on Tuesday was Sales Library.  The Sales Library helps sales people organize and share their sales content.  The interface is very clean and elegant.  The transitions are smooth and useful.  Very impressive stuff!  Here is a photo of the Sales Library demo from Oracle OpenWorld (courtesy of Todd Ruhl):</p>

<p><img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/sales_library.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Still one more Oracle Flex application left to announce.  Stay tuned.</p>
