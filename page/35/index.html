  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the benefits of working for Adobe is that I get to test new products while they are still in the pre-release state.  One night a few weeks ago I was able to install a pre-alpha build of Flash Player 9 on Linux.  I couldn&#8217;t contain my excitement when I pulled up my first Flex 2 app on my Gentoo laptop.  Smiling from ear to ear I ran over to <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/emmy/">Emmy Huang</a> (who, as usual, was still working at 7pm), and I thanked her.  And the next day I also had the chance to thank <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/">Mike Melanson</a>, <a href="http://www.kaourantin.net/">Tinic Uro</a> who are also investing a lot of time making Flash Player 9 on Linux a reality.  Many others at Adobe are also working hard to get the public beta out the door.  Most Flex 2 apps I have tested are working, but there are still frequent browser crashes and other bugs that the team needs to fit before we can send a beta out the door.  But we are close and I can&#8217;t wait to watch the very eager Linux community get their hands on Flash Player 9.</p>

<p>Flex 2 and Flash Player 9 are changing how the world builds and experiences web applications.  Now we have a ubiquitous and consistent virtual machine to run real applications in.  And we have an amazing programming model and SDK to build those applications with.  Best of all, it&#8217;s all free (as in beer)!  I have been working with JBoss on a Flex based collaboration client and the results have been stunning.  It&#8217;s beautiful, extremely fast, and as soon as Flash Player 9 on Linux debuts it will work the same on any OS or browser, without any &#8220;if IE&#8221; workarounds!  When <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo">Apollo</a> is available this will get even more interesting since we can take the same collaboration client application and run it offline, without the browser! Just to further drench Linux users appetites for Flash Player 9 here is a screenshot of the JBoss Collaboration Client running in Flash Player 9 on Linux:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/screenshot.png"><img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/screenshot-small.png" alt="Flash 9 on Linux" /></a></p>

<p>Amazingly it actually works without any problems and looks exactly the same on Linux as it does on Mac and Windows!  Write once, debug once, run anywhere actualized!  (By &#8220;debug once&#8221; I am of-course referring to only having to debug on one OS and one browser.)  This is the future of web applications!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>UPDATE - I&#8217;ve created a <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/blog/2009/04/16/flex-paint-2/">new version of Flex Paint</a> which doesn&#8217;t require the server roundtrip.</p>

<p>Flex allows you to easily create beautiful UIs.  But what if you want to take a piece of the UI and save it as an image?  Well, using <a href="http://www.kaourantin.net/2005/10/png-encoder-in-as3.html">Tinic&#8217;s AS3 PNG Encoder</a>, Remote Object, and Flash&#8217;s BitmapData and ByteArray API it&#8217;s very easy.  To show how this is done, I created a simple application called Flex Paint.</p>

<p><strong>Flex Paint</strong> (requires Flash 9)</p>

<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>

<p>We use the Flash drawing API to draw on a canvas.  Then when the &#8220;Save Image&#8221; button is clicked we do a few simple things.  First we create a new BitmapData object:
var bd:BitmapData = new BitmapData(canvas.width,canvas.height);</p>

<p>Then we copy canvas&#8217; pixels onto the BitmapData object:
bd.draw(canvas);</p>

<p>Now we convert the BitmapData object to a ByteArray encoded as a PNG:
var ba:ByteArray = PNGEnc.encode(bd);</p>

<p>And then upload the PNG via Remote Object:
ro.doUpload(ba);</p>

<p>Then Remote Object just saves the file to the file system.  If you would like to download the code for Flex Paint, you can find it on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexapps/">Source Forge</a>.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently conducted an eSeminar on building enterprise applications with Flex Builder and Flex Data Services.  You can view the recording of that presentation at: <a href="http://seminars.breezecentral.com/p24622178/">http://seminars.breezecentral.com/p24622178/</a></p>

<p>In my session I promised that I would formally document the process for debugging Flex &amp; Java together in Flex Builder.  So finally, here is that documentation.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t already done so, the first thing you will need to do is install Flex Builder 2 as an Eclipse Plugin and Flex Data Services with integrated JRun.  You can get these products on the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=flex">Adobe website</a>.  I use FDS with JRun for this example, but you could easily use Tomcat or any other app server.  A few steps may change slightly, but the general concepts would be the same.</p>

<p>Now just follow along.</p>

<p>1) Start Flex Builder &amp; Flex Data Services</p>

<p>2) Create a new Flex Project in Flex Builder
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/1a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>2.1) Specify that the application will use Flex Data Services and that the application should be compiled on the server
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/2a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>2.2) Click Next
2.3) Locate the root folder of your FDS samples application; mine is E:\fds2\jrun4\servers\default\samples
2.4) Change the root URL to be the URL to the samples application; mine is http://localhost:8700/samples/
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/2-5a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>2.5) Click Next
2.4) Lets name the project crm
2.5) Uncheck the &#8220;Use default location&#8221; box
2.6) Specify the Folder as <your_fds_samples_application>\dataservice\crm for instance mine is: E:\fds2\jrun4\servers\default\samples\dataservice\crm
2.7) Specify the Main application file as mini.mxml
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/3a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>2.8) Select Finish</p>

<p>3) Test everything by right-clicking on the mini.mxml file in the Eclipse Navigator, then Run As -> Flex Application
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/4a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>3.1) Your browser should load the mini application and look like:
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/5a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>4) Now back to Flex Builder where we will create another new project, but this time a Java Project
4.1) Name the project samples_server
4.2) Create the project from existing source, specifying the WEB-INF folder of the samples application, in my case: E:\fds2\jrun4\servers\default\samples\WEB-INF
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/6a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>4.3) Select Next
4.4) Go to the Libraries tab and select &#8220;Add External JARs&#8221;
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/7a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>4.5) Select the jrun.jar file located in <your_fds_install>\jrun4\lib
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/8a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>4.6) Also add the flex-services.jar located in <your_fds_install>\jrun4\servers\lib
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/9a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>4.7) Select Finish</p>

<p>5) Setup Java Debugging
5.1) Shutdown Flex Data Services
5.2) In the Eclipse Navigator browse to the src/samples.crm/EmployeeDAO.java class
5.3) Right-click on the EmployeeDAO.java file and select Debug As -> Debug&#8230;
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/10a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>5.4) Select Java_Application then New
5.5) Specify the name as &#8220;JRun_Debug&#8221;
5.6) Check the box &#8220;Include libraries when searching for a main class&#8221;
5.7) Enter the Main class: jrunx.kernel.JRun
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/11a.png" alt="" />
5.8) Select the Arguments tab and enter &#8220;-start default&#8221; for the program arguments and &#8220;-Xms32m -Xmx384m -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false&#8221; for the VM arguments
5.9) Select the Apply button
5.10) Select the Debug button
5.11) Insure that Flex Data Services started
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/12a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>6) Set a breakpoint in EmployeeDAO.java in the findEmployeesByCompany method
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/13a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>7) Set a breakpoint in mini.mxml in the fill function
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/14a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>8) Right-click on mini.mxml in the Eclipse Navigator and select Debug As -> Flex Application
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/15a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>9) You should hit the breakpoint in the mini Flex application, then select Resume in the debugger
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/16a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>10) You should hit the breakpoint in the Java backend
<img src="http://www.cayambe.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/17a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>11) Now jump up and down with joy saying &#8220;I can actually debug web applications!&#8221;</p>

<p>I hope this is helpful for you.  It&#8217;s sure helped me figure out just where things in my applications were going wrong.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished the first beta release of WeBudget based on Flex 1.5, Cairngorm 0.99, and EJB 3.  My wife and I use WeBudget to manage our personal budget.  This version was an attempt to learn Cairngorm and EJB 3.  Cairngorm really helped to organize the Flex code like a typical J2EE project which makes the code easier to debug and maintain.  EJB 3 makes writing backend Java code brainless.  The combination of Flex, Cairngorm, and EJB 3 is a very compelling platform for RIAs.  The code is much simpler and more maintainable than the Struts applications I have built in the past.  I hope that those learning Flex will find this code helpful. And
hopefully
the Flex and Cairngorm veterans can offer their input on how to make
the code even more beautiful. Please let me know what you think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I created a simple WYSIWYG tool based on Flex, inspired in part by the <a href="http://www.zamples.com/">Zamples</a> idea of <a href="http://zamples.com/JspExplorer/samples/index.jsp">Live Code Examples</a>.  The goal is to do on-the-fly conversion of simple markup to Flash objects.  This code is particularly useful for environments where content management is seperate from the web application.  This is pretty basic and there may be better ways to do this, but I hadn&#8217;t seen this done before so I took a stab at it.  Feel free to suggest improvements!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the source code:

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I got into Macromedia Flex I have not been able to view .mxml applications in any Mozilla based browser on Linux.  Mozilla for some reason cuts off the Flash at around 240 pixels in width.  I have searched the web and Mozilla&#8217;s Bugzilla trying to find others who have also experienced this problem.  I haven&#8217;t found much.  A few Mozilla bugs seem to indicate others had this same problem.  But not enough for anyone at Mozilla or even Macromedia to care.  There has only been 1 post about this issue on the flexcoders Yahoo list.  So not really a big deal, except to those of us on Linux!</p>

<p>It seems that the problem is with percentage width embedded objects inside percentage width tables.  When writing mxml applications I can easily work around the issue by not using a table.  However, anytime I view someone else&#8217;s application who has not worked around this bug, I only see the left 240 pixels of the application.  I could try to file a bug with Mozilla, but I think that&#8217;s been done and didn&#8217;t get the issue resolved.  Greasemonkey to the rescue!</p>

<p>Greasemonkey is a Firefox extension which lets me easily manipulate web pages when they are loaded in my browser.  So I wrote a simple Greasemonkey script which fixes the problem!  Fo those interested, here is what you need to do&#8230;</p>

<p>Install the Greasemonkey extension from: <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/</a>
Install my user script from: <a href="http://www.cayambe.com/fix_embed_percentage_bug.user.js">http://www.cayambe.com/fix_embed_percentage_bug.user.js</a>
Go to: <a href="http://flexapps.macromedia.com/flex15/explorer/explorer.mxml">http://flexapps.macromedia.com/flex15/explorer/explorer.mxml</a></p>

<p>or any other Flex application and you should see the full application!</p>

<p>My script is just a hack.  If you have any ideas for improving it, please let me know!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past six months I have been building one of the first ever Rich Internet Application (RIA) portals. The project has been incredibly fun and wrought with many challenges. Since the inception of our crazy idea to build a RIA portal I have learned a great deal about where the web is going. My RIA adventure started when I first encountered Macromedia &#8216;s Flex Explorer. I saw the very elegant components, and I was awed. Then I saw examples of the code I would soon be writing, and I was hooked. I couldn&#8217;t believe that a terrible UI developer like me could so easily create a beautiful RIA. I dove right in and quickly built a prototype of our soon-to-be portal complete with DataGrids and RemoteObjects, which were written in Java and exposed via AMF to the Flash-based front end. After a short time developing in Flex I realized I could never again enjoy building a Struts / JSP / HTML web application. They are too cumbersome and tedious for me after seeing how easy it is to build web applications in Flex.</p>

<p>Along the way I began learning about other RIA technologies currently available and on the horizon. The most comparable framework to Flex is Laszlo. Laszlo has similar components and a similar programming model, but its key difference is that Laszlo is open source. A few of the other technologies I have played with and read about include Microsoft&#8217;s XAML, Mozilla&#8217;s XUL, a Java based RIA framework called JDNC, and the new kid on the block, Ajax. XAML is still vaporware, to be released with Windows Longhorn. XUL is a good framework but requires a Mozilla-based browser. JDNC is also a decent framework but relies on client-side Java, often a problematic experience for users. Ajax uses existing technologies, works in all modern browsers and is Google&#8217;s RIA technology of choice for Gmail, Google Suggest, and Google Maps. The race is on for which of these technologies, or perhaps another, will become the &#8220;standard&#8221; RIA technology.</p>

<p>The first RIA technology that achieves critical mass will be hard to unseat.  RIA vendors are facing a land grab, and any technology that hasn&#8217;t achieved a significant programmer base will be marginalized by Microsoft when they start pushing XAML.</p>

<p>Flex currently sits in first place in terms of adoption, but it won&#8217;t be there for long. The problem is that at around $20,000 for 2 cpu&#8217;s, Macromedia is blocking mass adoption by only providing an  enterprise pricing model. From Macromedia&#8217;s perspective, this might make sense. Of course they quickly want to recoup cash from their investment in Flex. However, this strategy seems short-sighted to me, because I think Flex is good enough to become the de facto RIA standard. The Flash player is essentially the cross-platform GUI toolkit us programmers have dreamed of for decades. It works exactly the same on different OS&#8217;s, browsers, etc. The new Flash mobile client could allow Flex to move into the cell phone and PDA market.</p>

<p>There are so many things to love about Flex. Flex creates a very natural and distinct separation of tiers, much cleaner than even Struts provides. Macromedia has built a wonderful IDE for Flex called Flex Builder. Flex really performs with the direction of Macromedia Professional Services. It pains me to see Macromedia exclusively focusing on the enterprise market because it leaves the little guys out; the ones who are building the frameworks and web applications of tomorrow. Most innovation happens in small businesses, and if they don&#8217;t have access to Flex because of price, they will not base their innovations on the Flex platform.  Macromedia is sacrificing long-term market domination in favor of short-term return.</p>

<p>The most-used web technologies of today flourished because they were friendly to the little guy. What I mean is that they were free, or at least very cheap; they had great communities, and they were good platforms to base a solution on. Macromedia&#8217;s business model leaves out the types of programmers using PHP, many of the Struts / JSP programmers, and many Flash developers. These little guys in the next nine to twelve months are going to want to start dabbling in RIA technologies. Where are they going to look first? Open source is where many programmers look first for frameworks. To compete against open source, and to drive adoption by SMBs, Flex needs a business model that provides pricing and deployment that will drive quick adoption.</p>

<p>Laszlo, being open source, has a slight advantage on Flex in this area, but until Laszlo aligns itself with existing open source communities like Apache or JBoss it will not capitalize on its advantage to the degree that it might. JDNC is too complex and client-side Java is pretty much dead. But what about Ajax? There isn&#8217;t a true framework for Ajax yet, but there clearly will be, and I think that it will give Ajax a great shot at eventually winning the race. All Ajax needs is a good PHP framework and a good Java framework and hoards of new RIAs will start to pop up all over the web. The PHP hackers will probably be the first ones out the gate with a quickly adopted framework. Tagging along behind will be a few different Java-based frameworks. I would  like to see Tapestry add some Flex-like Ajax components to it&#8217;s repertoire (which Howard Lewis Ship recently announced was on his to-do list). This would help the adoption of Tapestry and provide those in the Java world looking for a RIA framework with a great open source option. XAML will have a shot if Microsoft decides to release it before Longhorn, since by the time Longhorn is available, other RIA technologies will have had enough time to build quite a bit of momentum. As for  JDNC, XUL, and all the other RIA options, there&#8217;s just no compelling reasons to use them.</p>

<p>Under Macromedia&#8217;s current business model, Flex will never be more than a niche product, serving a declining percentage of a rapidly growing market.  The trap for Macromedia is that the little niche they will serve will only be profitable for a few short years.  Markets reward leaders, and third place or lower means death.  Right now, I predict that without any changes in Macromedia&#8217;s business model for Flex, that XAML and Ajax will fight it out for first and second place, and within five years or less Flex will be discontinued.   It would be a real shame to see a product with such opportunity like Flex go the way of so many other promising products because of a short-sighted business model.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The second version of the TreeGrid component is done.  It is working much better thanks to comments from Matt and Jose.  I was able to resolve all of the issues I was aware of except the hard coded reference to &#8220;product&#8221;.  I was even able to get recursion working.  I think I may have to eventually extend DataGrid so that I can add column sorting.  Here are the changes I would still like to make to it:
- Column sorting is currently disabled.  I would like to make it work&#8230;  Maybe it would just sort top level nodes.  What do you all think?
- Column resizing does not clip the disclosure icon correctly.  The Label gets clipped right, but not the icon.  Any ideas?
- Any other ideas to make this better?</p>

<p>Well here it is:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a while I have been wanting to create a TreeGrid component for Flex.  The
basic idea is to allow a user to navigate a Tree like object within a
DataGrid.  Well, I just finished a very hacky version 1:
Here are some problems with the current implementation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I get strange flicker when mousing over the cells.  Don&#8217;t know why.</p></li>
<li><p>If I resize the right column to cover part of the Title, the title doesn&#8217;t get clipped.  Don&#8217;t know why.</p></li>
<li><p>The code looks only for children named &#8220;product&#8221;.  I don&#8217;t know of a way to make this generic / configurable.</p></li>
<li><p>Only supports 3 levels because I can&#8217;t figure out how to do recursion in the disclosurePress function.  When I tried to call another function to do recursion the recursive method never got called.  Don&#8217;t know why.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Other than all that, it works decently.  :)  Any ActionScript experts out there, please help me out.  :)</p>
