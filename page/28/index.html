  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Ed Abbo&#8217;s keynote at Oracle OpenWorld on Tuesday, Oracle announced two new products that are built with Flex.  The first, Sales Prospector, will go live in the first half of 2008.  The Sales Prospector helps companies make better sales forecasts and in the words of Larry Ellison the software will &#8220;help the salesperson sell&#8221; instead of just forecast.  The demo looked great!  I can&#8217;t wait to try it out!  Here is a photo from the keynote (courtesy of Todd Ruhl):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://raibledesigns.com">Matt Raible</a> is one of those guys in the Java community who I&#8217;ve always respected.  He has been around for a long time and contributed a ton to making the ecosystem better.  He recently posted a few blogs about &#8220;Comparing JVM Web Frameworks&#8221;:
<a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/comparing_web_frameworks_time_for">http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/comparing_web_frameworks_time_for</a>
<a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/comparing_jvm_web_frameworks_presentation">http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/comparing_jvm_web_frameworks_presentation</a></p>

<p>I wanted to respond to Matt&#8217;s request to provide feedback about his presentation.  Due to the length of my response I decided to post it on my blog instead of in the comments on his.  So here goes&#8230;</p>

<p>Matt says not to believe evangelists, like myself.  But he does say to &#8220;believe developers that are experienced with the framework and have used it in production&#8221;.  Hmmm&#8230;  I&#8217;m both.  I was a developer who successfully built a production Flex based customer service portal on Oracle Portal and Oracle CRM.  Since then I was hired as an evangelist to help companies like Salesforce, Intuit, Oracle, BEA and many others successfully build production Flex applications.  I also still get to build production applications on Flex like my <a href="/census">Census RIA Benchmark</a>, the <a href="http://buni.org">buni.org webmail client</a>, and numerous others.  So if you think my view is untrustworthy that&#8217;s ok, there are <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=193593">plenty</a> <a href="http://flexblog.faratasystems.com/?author=3">of</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/javaposse/browse_thread/thread/d53ba7522d5f5028/3787226c7df1f555">others</a> who hold the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/javaposse/browse_thread/thread/ce89f73babc3729e/367ce3d05b72f91d">same</a> <a href="http://www.urubatan.info/2007/10/java-flex-cool-application-and-reliable-back-end/">views</a>.</p>

<p>First lets address Matt&#8217;s Pros of Flex:</p>

<blockquote><p>Produces Flash UI
Funded by Adobe
Has a “poster child” in Picnik</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Produces Flash UI&#8221; - Lets dive into a few reasons why that is a pro:
1) Consistent across browsers and operating systems
2) Native vector graphic support
3) Native video support
4) Performance of a JIT Compiler Enabled VM</p>

<p>&#8220;Funded by Adobe&#8221; - There are a few others that I&#8217;d probably highlight before this one, like:
1) Mature UI framework for RIAs
2) Back-end agnostic (Anything that can produce SOAP, RESTful, JSON, AMF, whatever)
3) Strong community momentum (now over 8000 members of the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/flexcoders/">flexcoders Yahoo Group</a>, over 600 Flex blogs aggregated on <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/mxna">MXNA</a>, over 50 worldwide <a href="http://flex.org/community">Flex User Groups</a>)</p>

<p>&#8220;Has a &#8216;poster child&#8217; in Picnik&#8221; - Picnik is great but I&#8217;d probably say something like &#8220;Has 130 &#8216;poster children&#8217; - <a href="http://flex.org/showcase/">http://flex.org/showcase/</a>&#8221;.  And that doesn&#8217;t include the thousands of non-public facing Flex apps.</p>

<p>Now lets address the cons:</p>

<blockquote><p>Flash is difficult to integration test
508 Compliance
Adobe Funded open source project</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Flash is difficult to integration test&#8221; - Not really.  Check out:
<a href="http://flex.org/ACDS/AutomatedTestingInFlex.pdf">http://flex.org/ACDS/AutomatedTestingInFlex.pdf</a>
<a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/amcleod/archives/2007/01/flex_automation.cfm">http://weblogs.macromedia.com/amcleod/archives/2007/01/flex_automation.cfm</a>
<a href="http://renaun.com/blog/2006/11/27/161/">http://renaun.com/blog/2006/11/27/161/</a></p>

<p>&#8220;508 Compliance&#8221; - Works great!  Check out:

<a href="http://www.adobe.com/macromedia/accessibility/features/flex/">http://www.adobe.com/macromedia/accessibility/features/flex/</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Adobe Funded open source project&#8221; - I&#8217;m not sure how this is a con.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also like to respond to another comment Matt makes:</p>

<blockquote><p>It seems like learning Flex is going to be better for your career, but it&#8217;s likely useless without the Flex Builder - which is not open source.</p></blockquote>

<p>You can use the free and open source Flex SDK with any IDE you want.  Until recently when Flex Builder was released for Linux my primary IDE for Flex was vim.  That&#8217;s over two years of Flex development without Flex Builder.  It&#8217;s certainly possible and many people are using only the free Flex SDK to build their Flex applications.  They are building RIAs by only using open source Flex tools and not paying Adobe a dime.</p>

<p>Now we could debate these pros and cons all day.  But really it depends on what you are building.  What I find most interesting is how these frameworks relate to building Rich Internet Applications.  That helps narrow it down a bit since very content-centric applications differ greatly from RIAs.  But what is a RIA?  I&#8217;ve taken a stab at <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2007/10/17/what-is-a-rich-internet-application/">defining RIA</a>.</p>

<p>Based on those characteristics I can tell you more definitively how Flex compares as an RIA framework.</p>

<p>Connected - RIAs blur the line between connected and disconnected.  Flex provides the programming model for building applications that work as desktop and web applications.  In both cases there are a variety of ways to persist data locally and interact with other offline applications.</p>

<p>Alive - The success of the iPhone shows us that users want software that feels more alive - more like the natural world.  With capabilities like vector graphics, bitmap manipulation, drop shadows, translucency, etc all just baked into Flex, Flash Player, and AIR - creating interfaces that feel alive is natural and simple.</p>

<p>Interactive - We all interact with things and others in many different ways - visually, audibly, with touch, and, etc.  Flex natively supports video playback, web cam integration, and audio playback and recording.  In a recent application, I built <a href="http://www.goribbit.com/">Ribbit</a> phone calling right into the application.  And it only took three lines of code!</p>

<p>Responsive - It&#8217;s strange if I ask someone a question and they don&#8217;t respond in less than a second.  However most web applications force us to wait around.  My <a href="/census">Census RIA Benchmark</a> application was created to show the kind of responsiveness you can expect from Flex and web applications.</p>

<p>Overall what is most exciting to me about Flex, Flash Player, and AIR is how they really enable us to build better software experiences - software experiences that function and look more like the natural world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday at Oracle OpenWorld I co-presented a session with Dipock Das on Siebel CRM and Rich Internet Applications.  Dipock and I talked about how Rich Internet Applications are transforming the user experience in Enterprise Software.  We also presented a proof-of-concept I built with Flex in about two days.  Dipock and I were able to move from his paper-based mock-up and Siebel data file to a working application with only two short conversations and two days of coding.  The application, named &#8220;Contact Radar&#8221;, allows sales people to easily see how long it has been since they were in contact with their customers and potential customers.  Ultimately we wanted to illustrate how my <a href="/wordpress/2007/10/17/what-is-a-rich-internet-application/">four axioms of Rich Internet Applications</a> - Connected, Alive, Interactive, and Responsive - relate to Enterprise Software.</p>

<p>Connected - We demonstrated that the same application can run as a desktop application using Adobe AIR and as a web application using Flash Player.  In the POC we showed that a Flex application can easily run offline and integrate with other offline concepts like native drag-and-drop to MS Office.  The POC also connected to a Siebel web service to get its data.</p>

<p>Alive - Dipock and I wanted to build an application with an interface that felt alive.  We integrated natural world experiences like movement, shadows, translucency, and vectors deeply into the interface.</p>

<p>Interactive - There are many ways that we interact in the natural world - voice, touch, sight, etc.  One way we demonstrated this was to add <a href="http://www.goribbit.com/">Ribbit</a> calling straight into the application.</p>

<p>Responsive - In the natural world humans usually respond in less than a second.  Web applications however usually make us wait for much longer than a second.  In the POC we wanted to show how RIAs can have a sub-second response time for data operations like loading, rendering, and filtering.</p>

<p>Dipock has given me permission to post the live POC here on my blog so that everyone can see what we were able to quickly build in just two days.  In order to post the application I had to make a few small changes.  First the Ribbit calling has been disabled.  We are also using a much smaller dataset because we didn&#8217;t want to give out the real dataset with all those real contacts.  Also since this version runs in the browser it doesn&#8217;t have the offline features that the AIR version has.  Lastly remember that this was a POC built in two days - there are bugs.  Here is the app (<a href="/contactradar/oow.html">run it</a>):</p>

<p><a href="/contactradar/oow.html"><img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/contact_radar.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>There are still more amazing Flex applications from Oracle.  Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At Oracle OpenWorld yesterday the Oracle Enterprise Manager team introduced their new Flex based interface for doing database query reporting.  I am very excited to see this new use of Flex within an Oracle product!  The audience was very enthusistic about features like rich data grids with tree interfaces and custom chart item renderers.  These types of interfaces make DBAs lives much easier when they need to quickly find where there are bottlenecks and problems with their Oracle database clusters.  Here is a picture from the session (courtesy of Todd Ruhl):</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At Oracle OpenWorld yesterday there were Flex applications EVERYWHERE!  There are even more to come today but before that I need to show off a few others from yesterday that we were able to grab pictures of.</p>

<p>These days how can you do data visualization without Flex?  With the number of BI companies now using Flex it seems you can&#8217;t.  I&#8217;m glad to see Oracle&#8217;s BI team using Flex and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing more sexy dashboard goodness from them soon.  Here&#8217;s a rather blurry photo of the new Flex based BI Publisher Dashboard (courtesy of Todd Ruhl):</p>

<p>Keep up the great work Oracle!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I&#8217;m at Oracle OpenWorld watching a number of keynotes and sessions and I&#8217;m seeing Flex EVERYWHERE!  First up was the Monday Keynote with Charles Phillips where Oracle demonstrated a new Flex based MetaLink.  Back when I was a DBA/SysAdmin/Programmer I had to use MetaLink to get support from Oracle.  Working with the interface was like a trip to dentist.  Not fun.  Well, today Oracle demonstrated the new version of MetaLink built with Flex.  It looks great and using it is like a trip to the day spa.  Great job Oracle!  Here&#8217;s a photo of the new interface courtesy of Todd Ruhl:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/metalink.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are many more Oracle applications being demonstrated over the next few days that were built with Flex.  Stay tuned for more photos and announcements.  This is only the tip of the iceberg!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick note to say how excited I am that <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Exchange-MAPI-Connector-t4675512.html">Evolution will be getting a MAPI Connector</a>!  I&#8217;ve been using Evolution with Exchange since 2003.  Thankfully it works - but for me it crashes quite often.  So I&#8217;m really excited about the prospect of a better Exchange connector.  Screen scraping is just too brittle and too slow.  This should also improve offline support.  Currently before I get on a plane I sync Outlook in VMWare.  That works but I don&#8217;t care much for Outlook and VMWare is a killer on my battery life.  With this improvement to Evolution and the improvements that are happening with the video drivers on Linux, things are shaping up for Linux on the Desktop.  Could 2008 really be the year of Linux on the Desktop?  Just kidding.  I&#8217;ve been happily using Linux as my primary Desktop since like 1996.  It isn&#8217;t without some annoyances and required maintenance.  But neither is any other OS.  And at least with Linux it&#8217;s easier to fix stuff myself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/codemash_logo.gif" alt="" />I just received notification that I was accepted as a speaker for <a href="http://www.codemash.org/">CodeMash 2008</a>!  This will be my second year speaking about Flex at CodeMash.  Last year was a ton of fun!  Between sessions we would head down to the indoor water park for an Open Spaces session on the Lazy River or for some great conversations while waiting in line to try surfing the standing wave.  There were a ton of fun people at the conference and we even had some time to do an Open Spaces session on <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2007/01/20/flex-and-turbogears-at-codemash-displayshelf-widget/">using Flex and TurboGears together</a>.  This year I&#8217;ll be speaking about Flex and Adobe AIR in a session named &#8220;RIAs - Beyond the Buzz&#8221;.  With lots of great people and an indoor water park, CodeMash 2008 is a conference you definitely don&#8217;t want to miss!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At Salesforce.com&#8217;s 2007 developer conference, called Dreamforce, I did a few minutes of demos during the day two keynote with Marc Benioff and Bruce Chizen.  I showed three real applications built with Flex, Adobe AIR, and Salesforce.com.  It was a fun experience and I only had a few minor demo glitches.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/4418/adobe-flex-and-air-with-bruce-chizen-a-dreamforce07-keynote">PodTech</a> the video is below.  My demos are about four minutes in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jive Software has always stood out to me as being a company that really cares about the user experience.  I remember way back nearly 10 years ago when Jive Forums was one of the only (or at least most popular) commercial products built on the Java stack.  Recently I was able to meet some of the Jive folks when I presented at the Portland Java User Group.  You can tell that they are passionate about creating great software.  So it&#8217;s great to see that Jive Software is embracing Flex!</p>

<p>To see some of the Jive folks talking about Flex check out these videos:

<p>Jive, keep up the great work!  I can&#8217;t wait to see how you build amazing user experiences with Flex and Adobe AIR!</p>
