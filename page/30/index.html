  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bruce Eckel has posted a terrific article on &#8221;<a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=212818">Creating Flex Components</a>&#8221;.  As usual Bruce is able to promote understanding of deep technical topics through simple examples and clear narrative.</p>

<p>Article Summary:
<em>As Joe Nuxoll of JBuilder and JavaPosse fame will tell you (given the slightest provocation), one place where the Java designers completely dropped the ball is in Java&#8217;s component model. This becomes especially clear when comparing it with a system like Flex which has full language support for components.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just posted the newest version of the <a href="/census">Census RIA Benchmark</a> application which compares data loading via various methods in Ajax, Flex, and now Laszlo.  When I first began talking about the results of these benchmarks and heavily advocating AMF for large data sets some people suggested that my results were flawed because I wasn&#8217;t using gzip compression on the text streams.  I have always wondered how many people actually use gzip but these critics seemed to indicate that everyone was using it.  Based on some past experiments I postulated that AMF would still be significantly faster than using gzip.  There is a trade off when you use gzip.  The amount of data that has to cross the wire is significantly smaller but there is increased latency on the server to do the gzip and on the client to ungzip.  Sometimes this trade off is worth it.  Unless you are using AMF.  AMF uses a very basic form of compression that is extremely fast, faster even than just creating XML or JSON strings.  And of course much faster than creating big strings and then compressing/decompressing them.  Now there is definitive proof of this.  AMF is still by far the fastest method for loading large data sets in RIAs.  Not only is it faster for loading the data, Tamarin makes client-side operations like sorts and filters extremely fast.  All of this is evident if you spend some time with the <a href="/census">Census application</a>.  Check it out and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>For this version I&#8217;ve added a Laszlo test.  Sometimes people ask what the differences are between Flex and Laszlo.  This was my first time building anything with Laszlo so I won&#8217;t comment on the differences in programming models since my views are probably skewed after spending three years with Flex and only a few hours with Laszlo.  But two significant differences between Flex and Laszlo can easily be seen in the benchmark.  First Laszlo doesn&#8217;t use AMF3 that I know of.  Let me know if I am wrong about this so I can update the test.  Also Laszlo does not yet compile to Flash 9 bytecode so Laszlo applications are not able to take advantage of the Tamarin virtual machine.  Beyond that I really don&#8217;t know much about the differences.  If anyone that reads this has used both it would be great to hear about your experiences.  Just please don&#8217;t tell me that Laszlo is better because it has multiple output formats.  Tell me how this or other features have made a difference in what you have built.  Also since this was my first attempt at building a Laszlo application I may not have done everything correctly.  So please take a look at the <a href="http://flexapps.cvs.sourceforge.net/flexapps/census/">source code</a> and help me make it better and more accurate.</p>

<p>I hope that you find the Census RIA Benchmark application helpful.  Please let me know if you have any feedback about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week I have been in Crested Butte, Colorado at the <a href="http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/FlexAIRJam/Index.php">Flex / AIR Jam</a>.  It&#8217;s been a great event for everyone.  Those new to Flex have learned a ton and those with more experience have been able to extend their knowledge by working on real projects.  Over the past two days I&#8217;ve made considerable progress on two different projects.  One project is the new version of the <a href="/census">Census - RIA Benchmark</a> app.  I&#8217;ll be posting the new version with GZip support and a new Laszlo test tomorrow.  The other project I&#8217;ve been working on is an enterprise Flex application framework kinda like a portal.  This project is named &#8220;Anvil&#8221;.  The goals of Anvil are to support large Flex application deployment scenarios, illustrate best practices for application partitioning, and be a reusable open source framework for portal-like applications.  I&#8217;ll be publishing more info on Anvil in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Today we had a nice surprise.  We were heads down coding and Bruce told us to go outside to look for a rainbow because it was sunny and raining.  We walked outside to see an amazing rainbow that was brighter than any I have ever seen.  A few of us decided to walk down the street to get a better view.  I happened to find a nice flower pot which the rainbow seemed to end in&#8230;  Like a pot of gold!  I hope that many more of you will be able to find another pot of gold with us at the next Flex Jam!  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those who don&#8217;t know, MAX is Adobe&#8217;s yearly developer conference for products including Flex and AIR.  There will be tons of great presentations by many of our engineers.  Beyond the presentations what I enjoy most is the social aspect.  It&#8217;s the conversations that happen between the customers, evangelists, engineers, pm&#8217;s, execs, etc that make MAX great.  I hope that you will be able to join the conversation that will happen at <a href="http://www.adobemax2007.com/na/">Adobe MAX 2007</a>.  If you are planning on going, sign up by tomorrow so that you can take advantage of the early bird discount.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My friend <a href="http://ectropic.com/wordpress/">Jon Rose</a> has written a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/java_flex.html">great article</a> on using Flex and Java together.  Jon is a long time Java programmer.  We were coding Java web apps together back in the days before Struts.  It&#8217;s great to see Jon making statements like &#8220;Flex is the most obvious and elegant solution currently available to Java developers.&#8221;  The article also references some of my code from the <a href="/wordpress/2007/04/30/ajax-and-flex-data-loading-benchmarks/">Census App</a> to show how easy it is to integrate Java &amp; Flex.  If you are a Java programmer you should definitely read this article.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the &#8220;problems&#8221; with using Flex so much is that I get used to having a simple, predictable layout mechanism.  I seem to have forgotten how to do just about anything in HTML.  So can someone help me fix the Digg, Reddit, and Share This stuff below?  I&#8217;ve tried and tried and can&#8217;t figure out how to get the dang things to align correctly.  Ideally they would align to the bottom of a div or something.  Gosh it&#8217;s really embarrassing admitting publicly that I can&#8217;t do HTML anymore.  But since you have already seen how bad this blog looks, you probably already guessed that.  :)  Oh well.  Please help.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2007/07/26/2008-the-year-of-client-java/">previously discussed</a>, my friend Joshua from Sun <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/joshy/archive/2007/07/java_fx_updated.html">recently blogged</a> about how the consumer JRE will take market share from Flash in 2008.  Today Sameer Tyagi <del>, also from Sun, </del><a href="http://sameertyagi.blogspot.com/2007/07/flex-web-services.html">blogged</a> about problems with using Flex to front-end JAX-WS.  Both posts seem to insinuate Flash and Flex as competitors to Java.  Yet for me Java and Flex have always been a perfect match.</p>

<p>The continued success of Flash and Flex only helps to better position Java in the enterprise.  Adobe is not a threat to Java&#8217;s continued dominance on the server.  In fact many Adobe enterprise products are built on the Java platform including Flex Data Services.  If you must have an enemy then I suggest targeting those who actually have something to gain by Java losing market share in the enterprise.  That is definitely not Adobe.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2007/05/java_se_media_or_not_at_javaon.html#comment-630117">said elsewhere</a>, Java and Flex developers should be working more closely together to make building RIAs easier for developers and to make experiencing those applications better for end users.  Both technologies have similar values when it comes to openness, free tools and runtimes, and cross platform support.  And the areas in which Java and Flex overlap are really very minimal.  Developers and end users have much more to benefit by our harmony than by our discord.  I continue to meet many people who are embracing this vision of a harmonious union of these two great technologies.  I encourage others to consider doing the same.</p>

<p>Now to respond to Sameer&#8217;s disappointment &#8220;with the Web Services support, or lack thereof, in Adobe&#8217;s recent Flex 3.0 beta release&#8221; I built a quick Flex app which calls the non-trivial Web Service from the JAX-WS samples that Sameer referenced.  Here is the code for what I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml"&gt;

  &lt;mx:Script&gt;
  &lt;![CDATA[
  import mx.rpc.events.ResultEvent;
  import mx.rpc.events.FaultEvent;
  import mx.controls.Alert;

  private function handleFault(event:FaultEvent):void
  {
    Alert.show(event.fault.faultDetail, event.fault.faultString);
  }

  private function handleResult(event:ResultEvent):void
  {
    Alert.show("Your shipment number is: " + event.result.shipmentNumber, "Purchase Order Accepted");
  }

  private function submitPO():void
  {
    var po:Object = new Object();
    po.customerNumber = "1";
    po.orderNumber = "1";

    var item1:Object = new Object();
    item1.itemID = 1;
    item1.name = "a";
    item1.price = 1;
    item1.quantity = 1;

    var item2:Object = new Object();
    item2.itemID = 2;
    item2.name = "b";
    item2.price = 1;
    item2.quantity = 1;

    po.itemList = [item1,item2];

    srv.submitPO.send(po);
  }
  ]]&gt;
  &lt;/mx:Script&gt;

  &lt;mx:WebService id="srv" wsdl="http://localhost:8080/jaxws-supplychain/submitpo?wsdl" fault="handleFault(event)" result="handleResult(event)"&gt;
    &lt;mx:operation name="submitPO"/&gt;
  &lt;/mx:WebService&gt;

  &lt;mx:Button label="Submit PO" click="submitPO()"/&gt;

&lt;/mx:Application&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very simple example and doesn&#8217;t have the UI necessary to actually assemble a PO based on user input.  That piece would also be trivial so I&#8217;ve left it out of this example.  The key thing is that it correctly talks to the JAX-WS based Web Service.  This is just one example which uses Java and Flex together.  There are many more.  And there are plenty of enterprises happily using Java and Flex together.  Pitting these technologies against each other does nothing to benefit developers or end users.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://javaposse.googlegroups.com/web/FlexAndSwingCanBeFriends.JPG">friend Joshua</a> from Sun <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/joshy/archive/2007/07/java_fx_updated.html">has predicted</a> that &#8220;2008 will be the year that client Java starts taking market share from Flash&#8221;.  This is a pretty bold prediction reminding me of when I used to hear this same sort of statement about [Desktop <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,2073066,00.htm">Linux</a>&#8230;  &#8220;1999 will be the year of Desktop Linux&#8221;.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230;  I love Desktop Linux.  Been using it since about 1993.  And I love Java.  Been using it since 1996.  But lets be honest about the reality of client Java, desktop Linux, anything that touches the mass consumer space.  It has to just work.  I&#8217;m thankful that Ubuntu and the Consumer JRE are headed this direction.  But Flex and Flash are there today!  Flash just works.  So much so that in the first nine months, Flash Player 9 reached <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html">84% adoption in the US</a> and is likely well beyond 90% currently.  That is a platform you can rely on.  One you can build on today.  <a href="http://www.flex.org/showcase/">Tons of consumer Flex applications</a> have already been deployed.  And tons more are not visible because they are still being built or behind the corporate firewall.</p>

<p>So to my friend Joshua and his pals at Sun: Keep up the good work.  Seriously!  I&#8217;m excited about where you are going!</p>

<p>And to the people building Rich Internet Applications: As <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/jd/archives/2007/07/javafx_compiler.cfm">JD says</a>, &#8220;You can ship with Flash.&#8221;  Not in 2008, but today.</p>

Also, attendees of the Flex/AIR Jam will get a free copy of Flex Builder!  The Jam will be a fantastic way to learn how to use or extend your knowledge of Flex and AIR.  Bring your laptop and spend two days of hands-on, coached coding.  The RIA Summit will be a three day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_meeting">Open Space</a> style event focused on discussion about Rich Internet Applications.  I&#8217;ve been to events run by Bruce Eckel in Crested Butte before.  They are the best events I&#8217;ve been to and highly recommend them.  Go sign up today to get the early bird discount.  I hope to see you there!</p>
