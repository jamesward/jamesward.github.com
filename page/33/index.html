  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my credit card companies just implemented Mutual Authentication for their web site.  I think this is a fantastic idea since it can help to protect users from phishing attacks.  The hard part will be training users to not enter their credentials unless they see the tokens they selected.</p>

<p>Continue reading to see how Juniper implemented Mutual Authentication.</p>

<p>After Juniper implemented this new feature I logged in and had to select an image and a phrase:
<img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/cc_enroll.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now every time I login, after I enter my username, I should see the image and phrase I selected:
<img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/cc_login.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I really like the concept of this.  But I think it could be implemented in such a way that users wouldn&#8217;t have to understand the concept of Mutual Authentication and why they shouldn&#8217;t enter their password if they don&#8217;t see the image/phrase they selected.  What if the password was a combination of a strong, user-selected token, and something the user has to identify from an image they selected, that only they would know.  For instance if the image I selected was a map of the United States and the website asked me to enter my password, plus, select on the map where I got married, then phishing is more difficult.  To make this work there would have to be a few different picture question options that I selected when I first setup the mutual authentication.  Other ideas for picture question passwords:
&#8220;Circle your brother in the picture above&#8221;
&#8220;Pick your favorite color in the picture above&#8221;
&#8220;Select your favorite flower in the picture above&#8221;
&#8220;Select the style of car you drive in the picture above&#8221;</p>

<p>What do you think?  Would this sort of thing help prevent phishing attacks?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in the day Swing was so cool because you could make your app <a href="http://napkinlaf.sourceforge.net/">look like a napkin</a>.  Of course most of us don&#8217;t think much about desktop apps or applets anymore, so the Napkin craze faded away.  But I&#8217;m here to say that <a href="http://www.thebetterside.com/scrawl/ScrawlExample4.html">The Napkin Skin is back and better than ever</a>!  And now it&#8217;s based on web technology that people actually have and use.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past week I spoke at the <a href="http://www.codemash.org">CodeMash</a> conference.  It was a really great event full of stimulating conversation.  Even more fun than <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2676913860949129275&amp;hl=en">trying to surf in the wave machine</a> was an Open Spaces style session that <a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/">Kevin Dangoor</a> (creator of TurboGears) and I hosted.  We had planned to just sneak off into a corner and turn <a href="http://www.quietlyscheming.com/blog/">Ely Greenfield</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.quietlyscheming.com/blog/components/tutorial-displayshelf-component/">DisplayShelf component</a> into a <a href="http://www.turbogears.org">TurboGears</a> Widget.  However, word quickly spread that we were going to do this and everyone wanted to watch as we coded.  We had a bunch of fellow geeks huddled around every spare laptop and monitor we could find.  I shared my screen with VNC so that everyone could watch what Kevin and I were doing.  It was by far the best geek-out session I have had in a long time!  Check out a screenshot of the DisplayShelf widget in a TurboGears application, showing a picture of our geek-out session:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/tg_pic.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Continue reading to learn more about what we built, how we built it, and how you can use it&#8230;</p>

<p>The DisplayShelf is similar to the iTunes cover art display.  It&#8217;s built with the free Flex SDK, open source, and MIT licensed.  Earlier in the week I made the DisplayShelf work with TurboGears, but it wasn&#8217;t yet a reusable widget.  Kevin walked me through the process of converting my test application to a real widget.  In about twenty minutes we had most of the widget setup. To expedite the process we used an existing project to test the new widget. This particular project had previously been used to get the DisplayShelf running, sans-widget.  Very few times in my sixteen years of programming adventures have things with this many moving parts worked on the first try.  I coded the 3 lines nessecary to use the new widget, went to my browser and hit reload, one hundred percent convinced I would see an error message.  I saw the DisplayShelf, which I thought was actually still cached somewhere from my previous project.  I reloaded again, expecting to see an error.  No error.  I reloaded the TurboGears server, again expecting to see an error.  No error.  What is wrong?  Where is the error?  Surely this didn&#8217;t work first try!  I viewed the source of the web page and sure enough it was using the new DisplayShelf widget!  Everyone (excluding Kevin) was pretty amazed.  I guess Kevin is accustomed to these types of successes with TurboGears.</p>

<p>The next step was to upload the new widget to the <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/DisplayShelf/1.0">Cheese Shop</a>, a home for Python based widgets.  Kevin walked me though the process.  I expected this to be tedious&#8230;  Packaging things up in some strange way, navigating a difficult web site, uploading, etc.  Kevin again blew us away with the simplicity of doing this sort of thing.  Literally it was two commands to get our widget on the Cheese Shop.  Again everyone except Kevin is amazed.</p>

<p>Now that the widget was built and posted in the Cheese Shop it was time to test using the widget from scratch.  I did this with Kevin&#8217;s help, while someone else tired on their own computer.  Within a few minutes we both had applications which were using the new widget!  Again everyone except Kevin is amazed.  See the recurring theme?  Coming from a variety of backgrounds we couldn&#8217;t believe how easy it was to build web applications and use widgets with TurboGears.  Kevin just smiled as we all had epiphanies.</p>

<p>Using Flex for rich widgets in TurboGears applications is a great combination of technologies.  You get two great programming models and seamless interaction with both the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_Framework:FABridge">FABridge</a> and with TurboGears&#8217;s JSON support.  A few months ago Bruce Eckel and I recorded a <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2007/01/10/bruce-eckel-is-thinking-in-flex/">screencast</a> of us building an application with a Flex front-end and a TurboGears back-end.  The application we built used JSON to expose the TurboGears back-end to Flex.  We had really great success with this approach.  At CodeMash we took another approach and used the FABridge to pass objects from TurboGears to a Flex application.  Both approaches work really well and depending on what you are building, one may be more applicable than another.</p>

<p>Now lets walk through how you can use the DisplayShelf component in your TurboGears applications.  This assumes that you already have TurboGears installed.</p>

<p>1) Get the DisplayShelf component from the Cheese Shop:</p>

<p><code>easy-install DisplayShelf</code></p>

<p>2) Create a new TurboGears application using the quickstart wizard:</p>

<p><code>tg-admin quickstart</code></p>

<p>3) In the created project directory, start the TurboGears server with the created start script (your start script name is based on your package name):</p>

<p><code>python start-dstest.py</code></p>

<p>4) Add the DisplayShelf widget to your controllers.py file:</p>

<p><code>from displayshelf.widgets import DisplayShelf</code></p>

<p>5) Return the DisplayShelf widget in your default template:</p>

<p><code>def index(self):
return dict(shelf=DisplayShelf())</code></p>

<p>6) Copy some images into the static/images directory.</p>

<p>7) Replace the body of the welcome.kid file with the DisplayShelf (specify an array of the images in your static/images directory):</p>

<p><code>${shelf(['static/images/1.jpg','static/images/2.jpg','static/images/3.jpg','static/images/4.jpg'],height='600')}
</code></p>

<p>8) Load <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a> in your browser.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it!  You are now using the DisplayShelf in your TurboGears app! If you start the TurboGears toolbox and go to <a href="http://localhost:7654/widgets/">http://localhost:7654/widgets/</a> you will also find the DisplayShelf in the Widget Browser.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s that easy!  Thanks Kevin and <a href="http://compoundthinking.com/blog/">Mark</a> for all your help this past week getting me up-to-speed on TurboGears!  TurboGears truly is a world class web application framework!  And the widget system is by far the best I&#8217;ve ever seen!  Now lets get some more Flex based widgets created!  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sitting in Caribou Coffee in Ann Arbor Michigan looking out at beautiful ice covered trees glistening in the sunlight.  It&#8217;s Jan 17th 2007 and this day is going down in history!  Today is the day Flash Player 9 was <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/emmy/archives/2007/01/adobe_flash_pla_1.cfm">officially released</a> for Linux!  This is HUGE!  The web allows anyone with a PC to engage with information and others.  Flash has always pushed the limits of how that engagement happens, most recently with video.  Even though many Desktop Linux users prefer free software, Adobe has still committed to making Flash work on Linux.  I think this is noble.  Do you see MS or Apple doing this with their platforms?  By having Flash 9 for Linux, Desktop Linux is made all that much better.  I have been using Linux as a desktop since &#8216;96 and without Flash I would be missing out on some pretty amazing stuff.  Some will say &#8220;But Flash isn&#8217;t Open Source&#8221;.  You are right.  But if you don&#8217;t want to run proprietary software, rather than complain, go help <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">Gnash</a>.  Ok, now that I&#8217;ve espoused my religious views, lets move on to the cool stuff!</p>

<p><a href="/wobbly/wobbly.html">First the demo: Wobbly Windows on the Web</a></p>

<p>That&#8217;s using Flash Player 9 and was built with the free Flex SDK.  The wobble isn&#8217;t as refined as Compiz&#8217;s/Beryl&#8217;s, but that can be fixed once I (or you) figure out the math for doing that.  Let&#8217;s walk through how you can compile that application.</p>

<p>First get the code from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=174131">SourceForge</a>.  It&#8217;s in the wobbly module of the flexapps repository.</p>

<p>You need to get the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/sdk/">free Flex SDK</a>.  Also if you don&#8217;t have it, you will need the Sun JDK 1.4 or better.</p>

<p>Set the FLEX_SDK to where you extracted the Flex SDK to.</p>

<p>In the directory where you checked out the wobbly code, run build.sh</p>

<p>Load the build/wobbly.html file in your browser!</p>

<p>This still needs some work, and since it&#8217;s Open Source, I&#8217;d love your help!  Let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Recently Bruce Eckel and I had the chance to record a screencast of us pair programming with Flex &amp; TurboGears:
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/eckel_video.html">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/eckel_video.html</a></p>

<p>The results were great - a fantastic UI on top of a simple back-end!  Both Bruce and I learned a lot creating this screencast and I hope you will enjoy watching it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The buzz around Flex at JavaPolis last week was unreal.  It&#8217;s great to see so many Java developers get excited about the sexy UIs you can so easily build with Flex!  I even had numerous people approach me throughout the week and show me some cool Flex app they built in their first day of Flex programming.  Java developers everywhere are falling in love with Flex!</p>

<p>My &#8220;Flex and Java&#8221; session on Friday was tons of fun.  In a few minutes I was able to build &#8220;Sexy Flexy&#8221;, an application with a Sexy Flex front-end and a simple Hibernate back-end.  The application allowed users to take their picture, enter their name, and save them to the database.  Then using Flex Data Services these pictures push in real-time out to all of the people using the application.  I was hoping that everyone in the audience with a web cam would get on my wireless network and use the application&#8230;  True audience participation!  Unfortunately my wireless router was not cooperating, so it was just <a href="http://www.christophrooms.com">Christoph Rooms</a> and I taking pictures.  Oh-well.  But I have posted the application (slightly modified).  Check it out:</p>
