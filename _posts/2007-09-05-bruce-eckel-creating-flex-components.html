Bruce Eckel has posted a terrific article on "<a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=212818">Creating Flex Components</a>".  As usual Bruce is able to promote understanding of deep technical topics through simple examples and clear narrative.

Article Summary:
<i>As Joe Nuxoll of JBuilder and JavaPosse fame will tell you (given the slightest provocation), one place where the Java designers completely dropped the ball is in Java's component model. This becomes especially clear when comparing it with a system like Flex which has full language support for components.</i>
