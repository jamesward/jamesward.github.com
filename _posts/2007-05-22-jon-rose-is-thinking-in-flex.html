It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling when the guy I learned Java web programming with starts saying things like:

"<a href="http://ectropic.com/wordpress/?p=3">For me, Flex is clearly the way to go.</a>"

The whole article is a great read for those evaluating the Rich Internet Application landscape.

Jon, we are glad to have you "Thinking in Flex" and can't wait to see what you build!
