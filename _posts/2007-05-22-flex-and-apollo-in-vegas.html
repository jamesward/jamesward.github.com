This week I'm in Vegas for a few presentations.  First one is at the <a href="http://interop.com/lasvegas/education/webops.php">Interop conference</a> on Wednesday.  Interop is a fun place for me because I get to hang out with networking / sys admin folks.  In a past life I was a sys admin (thus the reason why I love vi).  :)

On Thursday night I am presenting at the <a href="http://gman.mxdj.com/flex_vegas_with_james_ward.htm">Vegas Adobe User Group</a> and really looking forward to meeting some of the Flex friends I've only known via email, blogs, twitter, etc.

I was also supposed to present at the local JUG but the meeting was canceled because there was a conflicting conference that everyone was going to be at.  Oh-well.  Time to go lose money instead!
