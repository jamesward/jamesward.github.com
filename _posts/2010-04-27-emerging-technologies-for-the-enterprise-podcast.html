While I was at the Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise <a href="http://phillyemergingtech.com/">conference</a> in Philly I was able to participate in a <a href="http://chariottechcast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=605733">very fun podcast</a>.  The casual chat was hosted by <a href="http://www.rimple.com/tech">Ken Rimple</a> of <a href="http://chariotsolutions.com/">Chariot Solutions</a>.  Participating in the podcast were <a href="http://www.twitter.com/adamcoomes">Adam Coomes</a> of Infegy, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/edburns">Ed Burns</a> of Oracle, <a href="http://twitter.com/cote">Cote</a> of Redmonk, and myself.  Topics ranged from cheesesteaks to turbo buttons.  Give <a href="http://chariottechcast.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=605733">it a listen</a> and let me know what you think!
