Tomorrow at 3:30 at Adobe MAX 2008 there will be a session on building rich Internet applications in the cloud using Salesforce and Adobe Flex.  They will even be <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2008/11/visit-us-at-ado.html">giving away</a> a new Macbook!  The combination of Flex and Force.com (the platform side of Salesforce) is a fantastic way to build RIAs in the cloud.  If you are at MAX this is a session not to miss!
