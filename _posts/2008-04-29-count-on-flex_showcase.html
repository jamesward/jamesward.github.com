<strong>326</strong> = Number of Flex applications in the <a href="http://flex.org/showcase/">Flex.org Showcase</a>.

Many Flex applications either require authentication or are behind firewalls.  However the <a href="http://flex.org/showcase/">Flex.org Showcase</a> lists publicly available Flex applications.  If your Flex application is not listed, go <a href="http://flex.org/showcase/howto.php">add it today</a>!

That's <strong>326</strong> more reasons you can Count on Flex!

"Count on Flex" is a series of blogs about the current state of the Flex ecosystem... by the numbers.
