It appears the Flash Player engineering team is <a href="http://thebackbutton.com/blog/73/64-bit-linux-freebsd-flash-player-exists/">making progress on 64-bit Linux support</a>.  There are no details yet on when this will ship.  But I'm sure <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/wordpress/2008/05/16/where-is-64-bit-linux-support-for-flash-player/">they could still use your help</a>.
