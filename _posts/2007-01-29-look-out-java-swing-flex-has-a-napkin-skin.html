Back in the day Swing was so cool because you could make your app <a href="http://napkinlaf.sourceforge.net/">look like a napkin</a>.  Of course most of us don't think much about desktop apps or applets anymore, so the Napkin craze faded away.  But I'm here to say that <a href="http://www.thebetterside.com/scrawl/ScrawlExample4.html">The Napkin Skin is back and better than ever</a>!  And now it's based on web technology that people actually have and use.  For more info about how <a href="http://onreflexion.blogspot.com/">Eylon Stroh</a> created this work of art, check out his blogs:
