<a href="http://infoq.com">InfoQ.com</a> has posted an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/05/interview-ward-flex-air">old interview</a> I did with <a href="http://ectropic.com">Jon Rose</a> at their QCon SF 2007 conference.  In this slightly dated interview I talk about the usual Flex, Adobe AIR, and RIA topics.  Makes me wish I still had my beard.  Gosh I was sexy.  ;)
