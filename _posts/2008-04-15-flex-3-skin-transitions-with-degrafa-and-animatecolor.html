It is always fun when you discover new product features that you never knew existed.  This happened to me last week as I was looking into Flex 3 skinning.  It turns out that not only can you use a single class with states to define component skin states (like "up", "down", and "over" on a Button) but transitions also work with these skins!  This feature has been noticed by <a href="http://www.asfusion.com/blog/entry/stateful-skins-in-flex-3e-color-transitions-in-buttons-now-possible">others</a> as well.  But I figured I'd blog about it anyways - because it's so cool!

Here is a quick demo:

I used <a href="http://www.darronschall.com/weblog/archives/000254.cfm">Darron Schall's "AnimateColor" effect</a> to transition between colors.  And I used <a href="http://degrafa.com/">Degrafa</a> to draw the shapes inside the skin.

It's super easy to add these types of transitions to your application!  Right-click on the application to see the source code.

Have fun making your Flex apps even sexier!
