Tomorrow night I'll be in Austin, Texas speaking at the Java User Group about <a href="http://www.austinjug.org/index.jsp?p=events-20100427">Better Software with Java and Flex</a> (Try the <a href="http://74.125.155.132/search?q=cache:QJI7olGFWdoJ:www.austinjug.org/index.jsp%3Fp%3Devents-20100427+http://www.austinjug.org/index.jsp%3Fp%3Devents-20100427&hl=en&gl=us&strip=1">Google Cache Page</a> in case the site is not working).  And then next week I'll be at Stir Trek in Columbus, Ohio presenting about <a href="http://stirtrek.com/Sessions.aspx">Flex and the Cloud</a>.  I hope to see some of you at these events!
