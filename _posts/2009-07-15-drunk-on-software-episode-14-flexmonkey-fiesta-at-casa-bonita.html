To celebrate the <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/blog/2009/07/14/give-your-mouse-a-break-flexmonkey-1-0-released/">launch of FlexMonkey 1.0</a>, Drunk on Software went to Cartman's most favorite place in the whole world - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Bonita">Casa Bonita</a>.  And there at Casa Bonita amongst happy children and cliff divers, <a href="http://www.drunkonsoftware.com/2009/07/14/episode-14-flexmonkey/">Episode 14</a> came to be.  I'm not sure if it was the margaritas, my pink feather boa, or the ambiance of Casa Bonita but this one was really fun.  So grab a marg, sit back, and drift to that happy place - it's Drunk on Software at Casa Bonita!

And please don't forget... You can drink and code but never, ever, ever drink and drive.
