Next week I'll be presenting at two great Flex events here in Denver, Colorado.  On Sunday April 10th, <a href="http://gregsramblings.com/">Greg Wilson</a> and I will be presenting an "Intro to Building Mobile Apps" at <a href="http://www.360flex.com/">360|Flex</a>.  Then on Tuesday April 12 <a href="http://www.digitalprimates.net/author/codeslinger/">Mike Labriola</a> and I will leave the world of Flex bewildered and befuddled when we present "Planet of the AOPs" (also at 360|Flex).  And on Thursday April 14 I'll be presenting "Building Cross-Device Apps with Flex" at the <a href="http://ria5280.org/calendar/event/2011/4/14/251740">Denver Flex Camp</a>.  It's going to be a really fun week and I hope to see you there!
