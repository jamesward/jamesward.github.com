The Thinking in Flex keynote which <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=234135">Bruce Eckel</a>, <a href="http://christophrooms.com/">Christoph Rooms</a>, and I did at JavaPolis 2007 has been posted!  <a href="http://parleys.com/display/PARLEYS/Home#slide=1;talk=15138862;title=Thinking in Flex">Check it out!</a>

Let me know what you think.

BTW: Don't you love that <a href="http://www.parleys.com">Parleys.com</a> is a Flex app?!?  And they also have an Adobe AIR version of their app which works pretty well on Linux.  (To install the Parleys AIR app on Linux install <a href="http://labs.adobe.com">Adobe AIR for Linux</a> and then get <a href="http://www.parleys.com/download/attachments/3440646/Pandora.air">the Parleys .air file</a>.)
