The second version of the TreeGrid component is done.  It is working much better thanks to comments from Matt and Jose.  I was able to resolve all of the issues I was aware of except the hard coded reference to "product".  I was even able to get recursion working.  I think I may have to eventually extend DataGrid so that I can add column sorting.  Here are the changes I would still like to make to it:
- Column sorting is currently disabled.  I would like to make it work...  Maybe it would just sort top level nodes.  What do you all think?
- Column resizing does not clip the disclosure icon correctly.  The Label gets clipped right, but not the icon.  Any ideas?
- Any other ideas to make this better?

Well here it is:

Please let me know your comments and suggestions.
