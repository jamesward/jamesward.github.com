In a few weeks I'll be over in Amsterdam for <a href="http://www.nljug.org/jfall/">JFall</a> and <a href="http://www.flexcamp.nl/">FlexCamp</a>.  Both events will have some new and exciting presentations about Adobe AIR and Flex.  At JFall I'll be presenting "<a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2008/sessions/00036/">The Future of the Open Source Flex SDK</a>" and at the FlexCamp I'll be presenting "<a href="http://www.nljug.org/jfall/">Gumbo, what will bring Flex4 to us</a>".  I hope to see you there!
