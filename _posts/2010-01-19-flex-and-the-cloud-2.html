The combination of Flex and The Cloud is quickly becoming an IT and paradigm changing combination.  Here are a number of recently published resources for learning more about this :
<ul>
<li>An article I wrote has been published on the online Flash &amp; Flex Developer's Magazine: <a href="http://ffdmag.com/download-1-2010">Flex and The Cloud: Is this really just Client/Server 2.0?</a></li>
<li>I'll be speaking on <a href="http://ria5280.org/calendar/event/2010/2/18/163821">Thursday, February 18 2010 at the Denver Flex User Group</a> about Flex and The Cloud</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=list&loc=en_us&type=ondemand_seminar&product=&interest=int_rich_internet_applications&audience=&sdid=EGMQU">recording of a webinar</a> I co-hosted on the new Salesforce.com Cloud platform for developers has been posted</li>
<li>Jeff Douglas has posted <a href="http://blog.jeffdouglas.com/2010/01/11/developing-apps-with-the-stratus-framework/">a video walk through</a> showing how to use the new Salesforce.com Flash Builder 4 extension for Flex + Cloud apps</li>
