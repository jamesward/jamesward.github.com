<font color="#ff0000">UPDATE 1: The first version of this demo was intended to show how to hook up touch events to the Flex 4 List / DataGroup controls. I've posted <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/2010/02/21/flex-performance-on-mobile-devices/">a new version</a> that adds some optimizations for the touch event handling and adds the kinetic flick behavior.</font>

One of the challenges of running existing web content on mobile devices is that user interactions differ between mediums.  For instance, on a normal computer with a mouse, scrolling though lists is often done by clicking on scroll bars or mouse wheels.  On mobile devices that lack a pointing device this is not the best interaction paradigm.  On devices with touch screens the paradigm for scrolling is usually a swipe gesture.

In Flash Player 10.1 there are APIs for gestures and multitouch events.  I thought it would be fun to hook up the list scrolling on a Flex 4 List to the <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/beta/reference/actionscript/3/flash/events/TouchEvent.html#TOUCH_MOVE">TouchEvent</a> on my Nexus One.  Check out the video:
