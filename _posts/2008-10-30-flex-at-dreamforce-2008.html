Just a quick note to let everyone know that I'll be at Salesforce.com's Dreamforce conference next week in San Francisco.  On Tuesday I'll be <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF08/tracks/learn.jsp?s=2#">co-presenting a session</a> on using Adobe AIR and Flex with Force.com.  The rest of the time I'll probably be in the developer lounge hacking on Flex code.  Stop by and say hello!
