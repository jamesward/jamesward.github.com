I finally had time to finish my upgrade to WordPress.  So hopefully I will be doing more blogging now.  In case anyone else needs to migrate from plog to WordPress, you can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cayambe.com/convertblog.phps">download the really hacky php script I used</a>.  Oh if you received a comment approved email from me for a comment you posted long ago, I'm so sorry.  I didn't realize WordPress was going to do that.
