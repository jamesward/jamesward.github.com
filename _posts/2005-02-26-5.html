For a while I have been wanting to create a TreeGrid component for Flex.  The
basic idea is to allow a user to navigate a Tree like object within a
DataGrid.  Well, I just finished a very hacky version 1:
Here are some problems with the current implementation:
<ul>
	<li>I get strange flicker when mousing over the cells.  Don't know why.</li>
	<li>If I resize the right column to cover part of the Title, the title doesn't get clipped.  Don't know why.</li>
	<li>The code looks only for children named "product".  I don't know of a way to make this generic / configurable.</li>
	<li>Only supports 3 levels because I can't figure out how to do recursion in the disclosurePress function.  When I tried to call another function to do recursion the recursive method never got called.  Don't know why.</li>
</ul>
Other than all that, it works decently.  :)  Any ActionScript experts out there, please help me out.  :)

Enjoy!
