Just a quick note to say how excited I am that <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Exchange-MAPI-Connector-t4675512.html">Evolution will be getting a MAPI Connector</a>!  I've been using Evolution with Exchange since 2003.  Thankfully it works - but for me it crashes quite often.  So I'm really excited about the prospect of a better Exchange connector.  Screen scraping is just too brittle and too slow.  This should also improve offline support.  Currently before I get on a plane I sync Outlook in VMWare.  That works but I don't care much for Outlook and VMWare is a killer on my battery life.  With this improvement to Evolution and the improvements that are happening with the video drivers on Linux, things are shaping up for Linux on the Desktop.  Could 2008 really be the year of Linux on the Desktop?  Just kidding.  I've been happily using Linux as my primary Desktop since like 1996.  It isn't without some annoyances and required maintenance.  But neither is any other OS.  And at least with Linux it's easier to fix stuff myself.
